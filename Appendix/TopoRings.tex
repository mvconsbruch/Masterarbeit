\section{Topological Rings}
To deal with the topological rings showing up, the notion of admissible rings
will be convenient (taken from \cite[Tag 07E8]{stacks-project}).
\begin{defi}\label{def:admring}
  Let $A$ be a topological ring. We say that $A$ is admissible if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The element $0 \in A$ has a fundamental system of neighbourhoods
      consisting of ideals.
    \item There exists an ideal of definition, that is, an ideal $I \subset A$ such
      that every open neighbourhood of $0$ contains $I^n$ for some $n$.
    \item It is complete, that is, the natural map
      \begin{equation*}
        A \to \lim_{J \subset A \text{ open ideal}} A/J
      \end{equation*}
      is an isomorphism.
  \end{itemize}
  We say that $A$ is adic if it admits an open ideal of definition.
  Given a topological ring $A$, we denote the category of admissible 
  and adic $A$-algebras (algebras $S$ with continuous morphism $A \to S$) by
  $\Adm A$ and $\Adic A$, respectively.
\end{defi}
