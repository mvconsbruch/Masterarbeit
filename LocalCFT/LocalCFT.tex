\label{sub:Application: The Local Class Field Theory}

Let $K$ be a local field with residue field $k$, put $q = \# k$, and 
denote by $\nu_K: K \to \Z \cup \{\infty\}$ the valuation of $K$, normalized
such that $\nu_K(\pi) = 1$ for a uniformizer $\pi$ of $K$.
The aim of this subsection is to describe the maximal abelian extension of
a local field $K$.

The Local Kronecker-Weber theorem gives an explicit description of the
abelianization of the absolute Galois group of $K$ only in terms of $K$:

\begin{thm}[Local Kronecker-Weber]\label{thm:localKW}
  There is an isomorphism (canonical up to choice of a uniformizer 
  $\pi \in K$)
  \begin{equation*}
    \Gal(\bar K/K)^\ab \cong \Gal(K^\ab/K) \cong \cO_K^\times
    \times \hat \Z.
  \end{equation*}
\end{thm}
Here, $K^\ab$ denote the maximal abelian extension of $K$, which can (after choosing
an algebraic closure of $K$) be described as $\bar K^{[G_K, G_K]}$. 

The extension $K^\ab$ consists of two parts, we have 
$K^\ab = K^\ram \cdot K^\nr$. The field $K^\nr$, the maximal unramified extension
of $K$, has relatively simple structure. 
Describing the field $K^\ram$ (or rather, it's completion) is the hard part and
it is here where we apply the theory of formal modules.

The valuation $\nu_K$ extends uniquely to $\bar K$, yielding a
$\pi$-adic norm on $\bar K$. Let $C$ denote the completion with respect to this
norm. An application of Krasner's Lemma implies that $\Gal(C/K) \cong \Gal(\bar
K/K) \eqqcolon G_K$
\todo{Ref}. One readily checks that any $\sigma \in G_K$ yields a 
continuous automorphism $\cO_C \to \cO_C$, and we obtain a short exact sequence 
\begin{equation*}
  0 \to I_K \to G_K \to \Gal(\bar k /k) \to 0.
\end{equation*}
The subgroup $I_K \subset G_K$ is called the inertia subgroup of $K$,
and we write $\breve K$ for the subfield of $C$ fixed by $I_K$. In particular
we have $\Gal(\breve K /K) \cong \Gal(\bar k /k)$. One readily confirms that 
$\breve K$ is complete with respect to the norm induced by $K$. 

As the Galois group of any finite extension
of $k$ is cyclic, we find that $\Gal(\breve K/K)$ is abelian. In fact,
it is isomorphic to $\hat \Z = \lim_n (\Z/n\Z)$. Hence
$K_\infty$ decomposes as $\breve K \cdot K_\pi$ for some abelian, complete
extension $K_\pi/K$ such that $K_\pi \cap \breve K = K$. Now $K_\pi$ is the 
completion of $K^\ram$. Observe that
\begin{equation*}
  \Gal(K_\infty/K) \cong \Gal(K_\pi/K) \times \Gal(\breve K/K) \cong
  \Gal(K_\pi/K) \times \hat \Z,
\end{equation*}
so Theorem \ref{thm:localKW}, the local Kronecker-Weber Theorem, is 
equivalent to showing that the Galois group of $K_\pi$ over $K$ is 
isomorphic to $\cO_K^\times$.
