\section{Local Class Field Theory following Lubin-Tate}


This section will serve as an introduction to formal groups and 
formal modules. Formal groups (or rather, formal group laws) were first
introduced by \textsc{Salomon Bochner} in 1946 as a natural means of studying Lie
Groups over fields of characteristic $0$, cf. \cite{Bochner1946FGrps}. 
The study of formal groups later became interesting for its own right, 
with pioneering works of Lazard \cite{Lazard1955FGrps}

\subsection{Formal Modules} % (fold)
\label{sub:Formal Modules}
As promised in the introduction, we begin by defining {formal group
laws}.

\begin{defi}[Formal Group Law]
    Let $R$ be a ring. A (commututative, one-\allowbreak
    dimen\-sional) formal group law over $R$ is a power series $F(X,Y) \in
    R\llbr X, Y \rrbr$ such that $F(X,Y) \equiv X + Y$ modulo terms
    of degree $2$ and
    the following properties are satisfied:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $F(F(X,Y),Z) = F(X,F(Y,Z))$,
        \item $F(X,Y) = F(Y,X)$,
        \item $F(X,0) = X$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{defi}
Given two formal group laws $F, G \in R\llbr X,Y\rrbr$, a morphism
$f: F\to G$ is a 
power series $f \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ such that $f(F(X,Y)) = G(f(X),f(Y))$.
Such a series is an isomorphism if there is an {inverse}, that
is, a power series $g \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ with $(f \circ g)(T) = T$.
This yields the category of formal group laws over $R$, which we notate by
$\FGLover R$.

The following statements about morphisms of formal group laws are 
useful and easily verified.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:FGLeasyfacts}
  Let $R$ be a ring and let $F,G \in R\llbr X,Y\rrbr$ be two formal
  group laws over $R$. 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Given two morphisms $f,g : F \to G$, the power series $G(f(T), g(T))
      \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ is a morphism of formal group laws 
      $F \to G$. In particular, $\Hom_\FGLover R(F,G)$ is an abelian
      group for any two formal group laws $F,G$.
    \item The abelian group $\End_\FGLover R(F)$ has a natural ring structure
      with multiplication given by concatenation.
    \item A morphism $f = c_1 T + c_2 T^2 + \dots \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ between
      $F$ and $G$ is an isomorphism if and only if $c_1 \in R^\times$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{xpl} Let us introduce the following two formal group laws.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{The additive formal group law}. Write 
      $\GG_a$ for the formal group law with addition given by 
      $\GG_a(X,Y) = X + Y$. 
    \item We write $\GG_m$ for the formal group law associated with the 
      with $\GG_m(X,Y) = X + Y + XY$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{xpl}

Next up is the definition of formal $A$-module laws. Naively, we'd like to say
that an $A$-module law is the same as that of a formal group law $F$
plus $A$-module structure, i.e. a morphism of rings $[\cdot]_F: A \to
\End_\FGLover R(F)$. But there is a subtlety going on here: Let 
\begin{equation*}
  \Lie: \FGLover R \to \Ab 
\end{equation*}
be the (constant) functor that sends $F \in \FGLover R$ to $(R,+)$, and morphisms
$f: G \to H$ given by a formal power series
$f = c_1 T + c_2 T^2 + \dots \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ to the endomorphism
of $R$ given by multiplication with $c_1$. The condition that 
$F(X,Y) \equiv X+Y$ modulo degree $2$ enforces that the induced map
$\End(F) \to \End(R)$ is a morphism of rings. Now, the $A$-module structure on $F$ 
yields an $A$-module structure on $R$, given by the concatenation\begin{equation*}
  A \xto{[\cdot]_F} \End(F) \xto{\Lie} \End(R), \quad a \mapsto \Lie([a]_F)
\end{equation*}

This is a morphism of rings, and we obtain that $R$ is an $A$-algebra. We'd
like the $A$-algebra structure on $R$ to be uniform. This
motivates the following definition.
\begin{defi}[Formal $A$-module law]
  Let $A$ be a ring and $R$ be an $A$-algebra with structure
  morphism $p: A \to R$. A (one-dimensional) $A$-module law over an $R$ is a
  pair $(F, ([a]_F)_{a \in A})$, where $F \in R\llbr X,Y \rrbr$ is 
  a formal group law and $[a]_F = p(a)X + c_2X^2 + \dots 
  \in R\llbr X \rrbr$ yield endomorphisms $F \to F$ such that the induced map
  \begin{equation*}
    A \to \End(F), \quad a \mapsto [a]_F 
  \end{equation*}
  is a morphism of rings.
\end{defi}
Similarly to above, we obtain a category of formal $A$-module laws over $R$,
which we denote by $\FMLOver A R$. Note that $\FGLover R \cong \FMLOver \Z R$.
Slightly abusing notation, we usually do not explicitely mention the $A$-structure
when referring to formal module laws, simply writing $F \in \FMLOver AR$, for
example. 

The following lemma explains a the functoriality of the assignment
$R \mapsto \FMLOver A R$.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:FMLFunc}
  The assignment $R \mapsto \FMLOver A R$ is functorial in the following sense.
  If $p: R \to R'$ is a morphism of $A$-algebras, we obtain a functor
  \begin{equation*}
    \FMLOver A R \to \FMLOver A {R'}, \quad F \mapsto p_*F,
  \end{equation*}
  where $p_*F$ is the formal $A$-module law obtained by applying $p$ to the
  coefficients of the formal power series representing addition
  and scalar multiplication of $F$. We sometimes write
  (with abuse of notation) $p_* F = F \otimes_R R'$. 
\end{lem}

Note that every formal module law $F \in \FMLOver A R$ yields a functor
\begin{equation*}
  \Alg R \to \Mod A, \quad S \mapsto \Nil(S),
\end{equation*}
where $\Nil(S)$, the set of nilpotent elements of $S$, is equipped with
addition and scalars given by 
\begin{equation*}
  s_1 + s_2 = F(s_1, s_2) \in \Nil(S), \quad a s = [a]_F(s) \in \Nil(S).
\end{equation*}
This construction yields a functor (with slight abuse of notation)
\begin{equation*}
  \Formal^F: \FMLOver A R \to \Fun(\Alg R, \Mod A),
\end{equation*}

where $\Fun$ denotes the functor category. We will mostly think of formal 
module laws in terms of this functor. Following this line of thought leads 
naturally to the definition of formal modules. 

\begin{defi}[Formal Group and Formal Module.]
  A formal $A$-module $\cF$ over an $A$-scheme $X$ is given by an equivalence class
  of systems $(U_i, F_i)_{i \in I}$, where $(U_i)_{i \in I}$ is an affine
  Zariski cover of $X$ with $U_i = \spec(R_i)$ and $F_i \in \FMLOver A {R_i}$
  are compatible $A$-module laws. Here, compatible means that there are
  isomorphisms
  \begin{equation*}
    F_i \otimes_{R_i} (R_i \otimes_{\cO_X(U_i \cup U_j)} R_j)  \cong F_j
    \otimes_{R_j} (R_i \otimes_{\cO_X(U_i \cup U_j)} R_j).
  \end{equation*}
  Two systems $(U_i, F_i)$ and 
  $(V_j, G_j)$ are isomorphic if the corresponding group laws
  $F_i$ and $G_j$ are isomorphic after refining the respective covers. 
  We denote the resulting categories by $\FMOver R X$ and $\FGover X$.
  A representing system $(U_i, F_i)_{i \in I}$ will be referred to as 
  a coordinate of $\cF$.
  
\end{defi}
In short, a formal $A$-module over an $A$-scheme $X$ is an
object in the stackification of the prestack $R \mapsto \FMLOver A R$ on 
the Zariski-site of schemes over $\spec A$. 

Of course there is a functor 
\begin{equation*}
  \FMLOver AR \to \FMOver AR,
\end{equation*}
essentially forgetting the choice of module law. The observation of Lemma 
\ref{lem:FMLFunc} translates to formal modules, a morphism $p : R \to R'$ 
yields a functor 
\begin{equation*}
  p_*: \FMOver AR \to \FMOver A{R'}, \quad \cF \mapsto \cF \otimes_R R'.
\end{equation*}
\textit{A priori}, a formal $A$-module $\cF$ over $R$ does not give rise to a
functor constantly valued in $\Nil(R)$. However, it does so locally, 
the local descriptions give rise to a line bundle $\cL/\cO_X$ (dependent on $\cF$)
such that $\cF$ is equivalent to a functor
\begin{equation*}
  \cF: \Alg {\cO_X} \to \Mod A, \quad \cA \mapsto \Hom_{\cO_X}(\cL,
  \Nil(\cA)).
\end{equation*}
Here $\Alg {\cO_X}$ denotes the category of quasi-coherent $\cO_X$-algebras,
and $\Nil(\cO_X)$ is the quasi-coherent $\cO_X$-module given on 
opens subsets by $U \mapsto \Nil(\cO_X(U))$. The $A$-module structure 
of the right-hand side can be described locally on $X$ after choosing 
a system of coordinates.

\subsubsection{Formal Groups over Finite Fields}


\subsubsection{Formal DVR-Modules}
Let $K$ be a local field with residue field $k$, put $q = \# k$, and 
denote by $\nu_K: K \to \Z \cup \{\infty\}$ the valuation of $K$, normalized
such that $\nu_K(\pi) = 1$ for a uniformizer $\pi$ of $K$.
The aim of this subsection is to describe the maximal abelian extension of
a local field $K$.
Local fields naturally carry the topology induced from the $\pi$-adic 
topology on its rings of integers $\cO_K$. To deal with the topological 
rings showing up, the notion of admissible rings will be convenient (taken from
\cite[Tag 07E8]{stacks-project}).

\begin{defi}
  Let $A$ be a topological ring. We say that $A$ is admissible if
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The element $0 \in A$ has a fundamental system of neighbourhoods
      consisting of ideals.
    \item There exists an ideal of definition, that is, an ideal $I \subset A$ such
      that every open neighbourhood of $0$ contains $I^n$ for some $n$.
    \item It is complete, that is, the natural map
      \begin{equation*}
        A \to \lim_{J \subset A \text{ open ideal}} A/J
      \end{equation*}
      is an isomorphism.
  \end{itemize}
  We say that $A$ is adic if it admits an open ideal of definition.
  Given a topological ring $A$, we denote the category of admissible 
  and adic $A$-algebras (algebras $S$ with continuous morphism $A \to S$) by
  $\Adm A$ and $\Adic A$, respectively.
\end{defi}

Suppose that $R$ is a local, adic $\cO_K$-algebra. Then any $\cF \in \FMOver
{\cO_K} R$ yields a functor 
\begin{equation*}
  \Adm R \to \Mod {\cO_K}, \quad S \mapsto S^\cici \coloneqq \{s \in S \mid
  \lim_{n \to \infty} s^n = 0\},
\end{equation*}
with $A$-module structure on $S^\cici$ given explicitly after choosing a
coordinate of $\cF$. Indeed, infinite sums over null sequences converge 
by completeness of admissible algebras.



\subsection{Application: The Local Kronecker-Weber Theorem} % (fold)
\label{ssub:Formal Modules over algebraically closed fields}
Let $K$, $k$, $\nu_K$ be as above. The Local Kronecker-Weber theorem gives an explicit
description of the abelianization of the absolute Galois group of $K$ only in 
terms of $K$:

\begin{thm}[Local Kronecker-Weber]\label{thm:localKW}
  There is an isomorphism (canonical up to choice of a uniformizer 
  $\pi \in K$)
  \begin{equation*}
    \Gal(\bar K/K)^\ab \cong \Gal(K^\ab/K) \cong \cO_K^\times
    \times \hat \Z.
  \end{equation*}
\end{thm}
Here, $K^\ab$ denote the maximal abelian extension of $K$, which can (after choosing
an algebraic closure of $K$) be described as $\bar K^{[G_K, G_K]}$. 

The extension $K^\ab$ consists of two parts, we have 
$K^\ab = K^\ram \cdot K^\nr$. The field $K^\nr$, the maximal unramified extension
of $K$, has relatively simple structure. 
Describing the field $K^\ram$ (or rather, it's completion) is the hard part and
it is here where we apply the theory of formal modules.

The valuation $\nu_K$ extends uniquely to $\bar K$, yielding a
$\pi$-adic norm on $\bar K$. Let $C$ denote the completion with respect to this
norm. An application of Krasner's Lemma implies that $\Gal(C/K) \cong \Gal(\bar
K/K) \eqqcolon G_K$
\todo{Ref}. One readily checks that any $\sigma \in G_K$ yields a 
continuous automorphism $\cO_C \to \cO_C$, and we obtain a short exact sequence 
\begin{equation*}
  0 \to I_K \to G_K \to \Gal(\bar k /k) \to 0.
\end{equation*}
The subgroup $I_K \subset G_K$ is called the inertia subgroup of $K$,
and we write $\breve K$ for the subfield of $C$ fixed by $I_K$. In particular
we have $\Gal(\breve K /K) \cong \Gal(\bar k /k)$. One readily confirms that 
$\breve K$ is complete with respect to the norm induced by $K$. 

As the Galois group of any finite extension
of $k$ is cyclic, we find that $\Gal(\breve K/K)$ is abelian. In fact,
it is isomorphic to $\hat \Z = \lim_n (\Z/n\Z)$. Hence
$K_\infty$ decomposes as $\breve K \cdot K_\pi$ for some abelian, complete
extension $K_\pi/K$ such that $K_\pi \cap \breve K = K$. Now $K_\pi$ is the 
completion of $K^\ram$. Observe that
\begin{equation*}
  \Gal(K_\infty/K) \cong \Gal(K_\pi/K) \times \Gal(\breve K/K) \cong
  \Gal(K_\pi/K) \times \hat \Z,
\end{equation*}
so Theorem \ref{thm:localKW}, the local Kronecker-Weber Theorem, is 
equivalent to showing that the Galois group of $K_\pi$ over $K$ is 
isomorphic to $\cO_K^\times$.
