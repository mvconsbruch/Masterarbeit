Still trying to get done with chapter 2... But I am close. 
The introduction of formal modules of arbitrary dimensions should propbably be
done at the very beginning, but then I'd have to rewrite the whole subsection. 
The part about exact categories is perhaps a bit unnecessary, but I had fun 
doing it.

Still trying to get done with chapter 2... 
Added discussion about Lubin-Tate Formal Module Laws, Logarithms and the Universal Cover.
Trying to get done with 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 soon-ish...

The basics caused me more trouble than I like. I was/am a bit confused about 
what the correct base category for formal $A$-modules is. In Lubin-Tate formal modules,
we really need the algebras $S$ we plug in to have $p \in S^{\circ \circ}$. 
This suggests formal schemes as a base. On the other hand, we might want to 
consider the base-change to $K$, the field of fractions of $A$, which is not readily
possible in formal schemes. We could therefore think about working over adic spaces,
but this is too much of a hassle.
I guess these things do not matter as much if we think about formal $A$-modules in 
terms of the local power series that give rise to the $A$-structure. Then
schemes is probably the correct base category.
