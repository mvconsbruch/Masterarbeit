### To Dos:
* Work over the later parts of section 1 and DL-Theory
* Maybe flatness of formal model
* shorten

## 10th of September
[09_10_version.pdf](./compiled_versions/09_10_version.pdf) 
* Got quotients done, and Section 4.
### To Dos:
* Finish section 6
* why are $\pi_\theta$, $\rho_\theta$ irreducible and $\pi_\theta$ supercuspidal?

### Big to dos:
* Proof of Proposition 5.2.11 (Equivariance of map between $\mathfrac M$ to universal cover)
* Proof of Proposition 8.1.4 ($\mathfrac X$ is a formal model for $U$)
* Finishing Section 6, Section 3 and Subsection 4.2 (mostly literature work)
* Finish construction determinant map of Universal covers as in [Weinstein, Semistable ...]
* Definition of supercuspidal representations

### Small to dos:
* Change $A$ to ring of integers of $E$ throughout, $R$ to ring of integers of $\breve E$.
* Replace admissible algebras by adic ones (more comfortable)
* Minor fixes in DLTheory chapter
* Proof of Proposition 8.3.4 (Application of Mieda's results)

Finally finished the section on DL-Theory.

## 28th of May
[05_28_version.pdf](./compiled_versions/05_28_version.pdf) 
I wrote up the proof of the explicit correspondence, starting from the 
$J^1$-equivariant map.

## 15th of May
[05_18_version.pdf](./compiled_versions/05_15_version.pdf) 
I think I finally said (almost) everything there is to say about Formal Modules. 
I might have to expand on Dieudonn√© Theory at some point, but I'll postpone this.

Minor Issue: It is not completely clear to me why the determinant map defined
in [BW11] is the same as the one defined in [Wei16]. 

## 8th of May
[05_08_version.pdf](./compiled_versions/05_08_version.pdf) 
Added the construction of the universal additive extension.

## 7th of May 
[05_07_version.pdf](./compiled_versions/05_07_version.pdf) 
Still trying to get done with chapter 2... But I am close. 
The introduction of formal modules of arbitrary dimensions should propbably be
done at the very beginning, but then I'd have to rewrite the whole subsection. 
The part about exact categories is perhaps a bit unnecessary, but I had fun 
doing it.

## 17th of April 
[04_17_version.pdf](./compiled_versions/04_17_version.pdf) 
Still trying to get done with chapter 2... 
Added discussion about Lubin-Tate Formal Module Laws, Logarithms and the Universal Cover.
Trying to get done with 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 soon-ish...

The basics caused me more trouble than I like. I was/am a bit confused about 
what the correct base category for formal $A$-modules is. In Lubin-Tate formal modules,
we really need the algebras $S$ we plug in to have $p \in S^{\circ \circ}$. 
This suggests formal schemes as a base. On the other hand, we might want to 
consider the base-change to $K$, the field of fractions of $A$, which is not readily
possible in formal schemes. We could therefore think about working over adic spaces,
but this is too much of a hassle.
I guess these things do not matter as much if we think about formal $A$-modules in 
terms of the local power series that give rise to the $A$-structure. Then
schemes is probably the correct base category.
