Still trying to get done with chapter 2... 
Added discussion about Lubin-Tate Formal Module Laws, Logarithms and the Universal Cover.
Trying to get done with 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 soon-ish...

The basics caused me more trouble than I like. I was/am a bit confused about 
what the correct base category for formal $A$-modules is. In Lubin-Tate formal modules,
we really need the algebras $S$ we plug in to have $p \in S^{\circ \circ}$. 
This suggests formal schemes as a base. On the other hand, we might want to 
consider the base-change to $K$, the field of fractions of $A$, which is not readily
possible in formal schemes. We could therefore think about working over adic spaces,
but this is too much of a hassle.
I guess these things do not matter as much if we think about formal $A$-modules in 
terms of the local power series that give rise to the $A$-structure. Then
schemes is probably the correct base category.
