\label{sec:Non-Abelian Lubin-Tate Theory: An Overview}
In the preceeding chapter we used formal $\cO_K$-modules to understand the 
maximial abelian extension of a local field $K$. The hope of non-Abelian Lubin-Tate
theory is to gain insight about the Abelian extensions of $K$ by considering
certain moduli spaces of formal $\cO_K$-modules.
More precisely, attached to a formal $\cO_K$-module $H_0$ over $\Fqbar$ (determined
up to isomorphism by its height $n$), we attach a system of rigid spaces 
$\{M_K\}_{K \subset \GL_n(\cO_K)}$, the so called Lubin-Tate Tower. For $l \neq p$, 
the system of $l$-adic compactly supported cohomology groups $\{H_c^{i}(M_K,
\bar \Q_l)\}_K$ admits commuting actions by $\GL_n(K)$, $W_K$ and $D^\times$,
where the latter denotes the units of the central divison algebra $D =
\End_{\FMOver {\cO_K}{\Fqbar}}(H_0) \otimes \Q$. This yields a correspondence of 
representations of the respective groups, and Harris and Taylor showed in
\cite{HTShimura} that the cohomology of middle degree induces (a version of)
the Local Langlands Correspondence for $\GL_n$. Our goal is an explicit
description of this correspondence, and we obtain such descriptions by
understanding the Lubin-Tate tower explicitely.
As it turns out, the the limit $\lim_{K} M_K$ is representable by a perfectoid space
which is is easier to describe than its individual layers.
