\section{Formal Modules}
This section will serve as an introduction to formal groups and 
formal modules. Formal groups (or rather, formal group laws) were first
introduced by \textsc{Salomon Bochner} in 1946 as a natural means of studying Lie
Groups over fields of characteristic $0$, cf. \cite{Bochner1946FGrps}. 
The study of formal groups later became interesting for its own right, 
with pioneering works of Lazard \cite{Lazard1955FGrps}. \todo{blabla}

\subsection{Basic Notions} % (fold)
\label{sub:Basic Notions}
As promised in the introduction, we begin by defining {formal group
laws}.
For now, let $R$ be any ring.
\begin{defi}[Formal Group Laws of arbitrary dimension]
  A (commutative) formal group law  of dimension
  $n$ over $R$ is a tuple of
  power series $F = (F_1, \dots, F_n)$ with $$F_i(X_1, \dots, X_n,Y_1,
  \dots, Y_n) \in R\llbr X_1, \dots,
  X_n, Y_1, \dots, Y_n\rrbr, \quad 1 \leq i \leq n$$
  such that $F_i(\mathbf X, \mathbf Y) \equiv X_i + Y_i $ modulo degree $\geq 2$
  and the following equalities are satisfied:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $F(F (\mathbf X, \mathbf Y), \mathbf Z) = 
      F(\mathbf X, F(\mathbf Y, \mathbf Z))$.
    \item $F( \mathbf X, \mathbf 0) = \mathbf X$.
    \item $F( \mathbf X, \mathbf Y) = F(\mathbf Y, \mathbf X).$
  \end{enumerate}
  Here, and in the sequel, we abbreviate $\mathbf X =
  (X_1, \dots, X_n)$, et cetera.
  Given a formal group $F$ of dimension $n$ and a formal group law
  $G$ of dimension $m$,
  a morphism $F \to G$ is a $m$-tuple $f = (f_1, \dots, f_m)$ 
  of power series $f_i \in R\llbr X_1, \dots, X_n \rrbr$ such that $\bff(0)=0$ and
  \begin{equation*}
    G(f( \mathbf X), f( \mathbf Y) ) = f(F( \mathbf X, \mathbf Y)).
  \end{equation*}
  For any $n$-dimensional formal module $F$, the identity is given by 
  the morphism $\id_{F}$ with components $\id_{F,i}( \mathbf X) = X_i$. 
  Composition of morphisms is given by composition of tuples of power-series.
  This yields the category of formal group laws of arbitrary dimension over $R$,
  which we denote by $\FGLArbOver R$. We will mostly be concerned with the full
  subcategory of one-dimensional formal groups, which we denote by $\FGLOver R$. 
\end{defi}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:FGLAdditive}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Attached to any $F \in \FGLArbOver R$ of dimension $n$, there exists
      a unique power series 
      $$[-1]_F(X_1, \dots, X_n) \in R\llbr X_1, \dots, X_n\rrbr$$
      satisfying $F(\mathbf X, [-1]_F(\mathbf X)) = 0$. This is automatically
      an endomorphism of $F$. 
    \item The set $\Hom_{\FGLArbOver R} (F,G)$
      is an abelian group with addition $f+g = G(f,g)$. 
      In particular, $\FGLArbOver R$ is pre-additive (cf.
      \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00ZY}{Tag
      00ZY}]{stacks-project}).     
    \item Furthermore, $\FGLArbOver R$ admits finite products. Thereby it is 
      an additive category (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0104}{Tag
      0104}]{stacks-project}).
      The unique final and initial object of $\FGLArbOver R$ is the unique
      $0$-dimensional formal $A$-module law.
    \item In particular $\End_{\FGLArbOver R}(F)$ is a (possibly non-commutative)
      ring.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
    The first statement is an application of the formal implicit function theorem,
    cf. \todo{citation}. The remaining statements are a matter of direct computation.
  \end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{xpl} Let us introduce the following two formal group laws.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{The additive formal group law}. Write 
      $\Ghat_a$ for the formal group law with addition given by 
      $\Ghat_a(X,Y) = X + Y$. 
    \item We write $\Ghat_m$ for the formal group law associated with the 
      with $\Ghat_m(X,Y) = X + Y + XY$. Note that $\Ghat_m(X,Y) = (X+1)(Y+1) - 1$
  \end{itemize}
\end{xpl}

\begin{defi}[Lie-algebra of formal group law]
Let $\Lie\colon \FGLArbOver R \to \Ab$ be the functor taking an $n$-dimensional 
formal group law $F$ to the $R$-module
\begin{equation*}
  \Lie(\bF) = \Hom_{\Mod R} \left( \frac{(X_1, \dots, X_n)}{(X_1, \dots,
  X_n)^2}, R \right) 
\end{equation*}
Given an $m$-dimensional group law $\bG$ and a morphism $\bff\colon \bF \to
\bG$, $\Lie(\bff)$ is the induced morphism
\begin{equation*}
  \Lie(\bF) \to \Lie(\bG), \quad \psi \mapsto \left( S_j \mapsto \psi
  (\overline{f_j})\right) \in 
  \Hom_\Mod R\left(\frac{(X_1, \dots, X_n)}{(X_1, \dots, X_n)^2}, R \right),
\end{equation*}
where $\overline{ f_j}$ is the reduction of $f_j$ mod $(\bX)^2$. 
\end{defi}
We have a canonical basis on both sides, and writing $\Lie(\bF) = R^n$, 
$\Lie(\bG) \cong R^m$, the induced map $\Lie(\bff) \colon R^n \to R^m$ is
given by multiplication with the matrix 
\begin{equation*}
  \left( \frac {\partial f_i}{\partial X_j} (0) \right)_{\substack{1 \leq i \leq m \\ 1 \leq j \leq n}}.
\end{equation*}

Now let $A$ be any other ring. We define formal $A$-module laws. Naively, we
would like to define these objects as formal group laws $F$
with $A$-module structure, i.e. a morphism of rings $[\cdot]_F\colon A \to
\End_\FGLArbOver R(F)$. However, given a one-dimensional group law $F \in
\FGLOver R$, the condition that $F(X,Y) \equiv X+Y$ modulo degree $\geq 2$
enforces that the induced map $\End(F) \xto{\Lie} \End(R)$ is a morphism of rings. 
If we are given $[-]_F\colon  A \to \End_{\FGLOver R}(F)$, this $A$-module structure on $F$ 
yields an $A$-module structure on $R$, given by the composition
\begin{equation*}
  A \xto{[\cdot]_F} \End(F) \xto{\Lie} \End(R), \quad a \mapsto \Lie([a]_F).
\end{equation*}
This is a morphism of rings, and we obtain an $A$-algebra structure on $R$. 
This motivates the following definition.
\begin{defi}[Formal $A$-Module Law of arbitrary dimension]\label{def:formalmodulelaw}
  Let $R$ be an $A$-algebra with structure morphism $j\colon  A \to R$. A formal
  $A$-module law over $R$ of dimension $n$ is given by the data of 
  a formal $n$-dimensional group law $F$ over $R$ and a morphism of rings
  \begin{equation*}
    A \to \End_{\FGLArbOver R} (F), \quad a \mapsto ([a]_{F,i}
    )_{1 \leq i \leq n} \in (R \llbr X_1, \dots, X_n \rrbr )^n
  \end{equation*}
  such that $[a]_{F,i}(\mathbf X) \equiv j(a) X_i$ modulo terms of degree 
  $\geq 2$. Morphisms between formal $A$-modules of arbitrary dimension are 
  morphisms of formal groups respecting the $A$-module structure. 
  The resulting category is denoted $\FMLArbOver A R$. The full
  subcategory of one-dimensional formal $A$-module laws over $R$ is denoted 
  by $\FMLOver A R$.
\end{defi}

Note that $\FGLOver R \cong \FMLOver \Z R$.
At the slight cost of precision, we usually do not explicitely mention the
$A$-structure when referring to formal module laws, simply writing $F \in
\FMLOver AR$ for example. 

Given an additional $A$-algebra $R'$, a morphsim
$i\colon R \to R'$ yields a functor 
\begin{equation*}
    \FMLArbOver AR \to \FMLArbOver A{R'}, \quad
    F \mapsto F \otimes_R R',
\end{equation*}
where $F \otimes_R R'$ denotes the formal $A$-module law obtained by applying $i$
to the coefficients of the formal power series representing the $A$-module structure of $F$. 
This turns the assignment $R \mapsto \FMLArbOver AR$ into a 
functor $\Alg A \to \Set$. The corresponding presheaf on $\AffSchOver {A}^\opp$ is  separated for the Zariski topology, 
but it fails to be a sheaf in general: the Lie algebra of any
formal group law over $R$ has to be free, and this condition cannot be 
ensured Zariski-locally on $\spec R$. It may therefore be 
advisable to consider the sheafification $R \mapsto \FMLArbOver AR^\#$ instead, but in our applications
$R$ will almost always be a local $A$-algebra, so considerations
of this type will not play a large role.

Every $n$-dimensional formal module law $F \in \FMLArbOver A R$
yields a functor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fmnilpfunc}
  \Alg R \to \Mod A, \quad S \mapsto \Nil(S)^n,
\end{equation}
where $\Nil(S)^n$, the set of $n$-tuples of nilpotent elements of $S$, is
equipped with addition and scalars given by 
\begin{equation*}
  s_1 + s_2 = F(s_1, s_2) \in \Nil(S)^n, \quad a s = [a]_F(s) \in \Nil(S)^n.
\end{equation*}
This construction yields a functor 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:formfunc}
  \FMLOver A R \to \Fun(\Alg R, \Mod A),
\end{equation}
where $\Fun$ denotes the functor category.

Passing from discrete $R$-algebras to admissible $R$-algebras (cf. Definition
\ref{def:admring}), this construction extends naturally to a functor 
\begin{equation*}
  \FMLOver AR \to \Fun (\Adm R, \Mod A), \quad F \mapsto \Spf R\llbr \bT \rrbr,
\end{equation*}
where we equip $\Spf R \llbr \bT \rrbr$ with the structure of an $A$-module object
using the endomorphisms coming from $F$. 



Following this line of thought leads naturally to the definition of
formal modules. 

\begin{defi}[Formal Groups and Formal Modules.]
  Given an $A$-scheme $X$, we define the category
  $\FMArbOver A X$ as follows. 
  Objects are $A$-module objects $\cF$ in the category
  of formal schemes over $X$, having the property that 
  there is a cover of $X$ by Zariski-open affine subsets $U_i = \spec (R_i)$
  such that $\cF \times_X U_i$ is isomorphic to $\Spf R_i\llbr X_1, \dots,
  X_n\rrbr$ and the induced $A$-module structure on $\spf R_i\llbr X_1, \dots, X_n\rrbr$
  yields a formal $A$-module law on $R_i$. Given $\cF, \cG \in \FMLArbOver AX$,
  a morphism $\phi\colon  \cF \to \cG$ is the same as a morphism of $A$-module objects 
  in the category of formal schemes over $X$.
  Again, we denote the full subcategory of one-dimensional formal $A$-modules
  over $X$ by $\FMOver AX$. 
\end{defi}

% \begin{rmk} 
%   Formal schemes (over a base an $A$-scheme $X$, say) locally isomorphic to 
%   $\spf \cO_X(U)\llbr \bT \rrbr$ are sometimes called Formal
%   Lie Varieties \todo{reference}. Equivalently to the definition above, we could
%   have defined formal $A$-modules as $A$-module objects in the category of
%   Formal Lie Varieties, such that the $A$-module structure
%   on the tangent space at the identity agr\textbf{}ees with the usual one.
% \end{rmk}

\begin{defi}[Coordinate]
  Let $\cF$ be a formal $A$-module over $X$. The choice of a cover $\sqcup_{i
  \in I} \spec(R_i) \to X$ together with maps $\spf(R_i \llbr T \rrbr) \to \cF$
  furnishing for each $i$ a cartesian square
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
  	{\spf(R_i \llbr T \rrbr)} \& \cF \\
  	{\spec(R_i)} \& X
  	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
  	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
  	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
  	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  will be referred to as a coordinate for $\cF$. 
\end{defi}

Of course there is a functor 
\begin{equation*}
  \FGG\colon  \FMLArbOver AR \to \FMArbOver AR,
\end{equation*}
essentially forgetting the choice of module law. Just as in the case of formal 
module laws, a morphism $R \to R'$ yields a functor 
\begin{equation*} 
  \FMOver AR \to \FMOver A{R'}, \quad \cF \mapsto \cF \otimes_R R'.
\end{equation*}

\begin{defi}[Lie functor]
  The functor $\Lie$ descends to a functor 
  \begin{equation*}
    \Lie\colon  \FMArbOver A X \to \QCoh {\cO_X}, 
  \end{equation*}
  given by locally describing a formal $A$-module $\cF$ via formal group laws and gluing the local data. Alternatively, it arises from sending 
  sending a formal $A$-module $\cF$ to $(\cI / \cI^2)^\vee$, where $\cI$ is the
  ideal associated to the closed immersion $[0]_\cF\colon  X \to \cF$. 
\end{defi}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:IsosCheckOnLie}
  A map $\phi\colon  \cF \to \cG$ of formal $A$-modules (of arbitrary dimension) over $X$ is an isomorphism if and only if the induced morphism of Lie algebras $\Lie(\phi)\colon  \Lie(\cF) \to \Lie(\cG)$ is an isomorphism.
\begin{proof}
  Choosing coordinates, we may assume that $\cF$ and $\cG$ come from formal $A$-module
  laws $F$ and $G$. Now the claim is an easy consequence of the formal implicit
  function theorem.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{xpl}
  % For any scheme $X$, the additive group law $\Ghat_a$ 

  Over $\Z_p$, the formal group $\Ghat_m$ extends to a formal $\Z_p$-module
  as follows. 
  As a functor, $\Ghat_m$ is isomorphic to the assignment
  \begin{equation*}
    \Adm {\Z_p} \to \Ab, \quad S \mapsto 1 + S^\cici \subset S^\times.
  \end{equation*}
  The subgroup $1 + S^\cici$ naturally carries the structure of a $\Z_p$-module.
  Indeed, for $k \in \N$, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    (1+s)^{p^k} = 1 + p^ks + \binom{p^k}2 s^2 + \dots + s^{p^k},
  \end{equation*}
  and given $s \in S^\cici$, this is of the form $1+ o(1)$ as $k$ gets large. 
  In particular, if $x = a_0 + a_1 p + a_2p^2 + \dots \in \Z_p$, expressions of  the form
  \begin{equation*}
    (1+s)^x = \prod_{i = 1}^\infty (1+s)^{a_k p^k}
  \end{equation*}
  make sense by Lemma \ref{lem:infiniteseriesandproducts}. This gives
  $\Ghat_{m,\Z_p}$ the structure of a formal $\Z_p$-module. 
  In the upcoming subsection, we discuss how this is the simplest example of a
  whole family of formal modules constructed by 
  Lubin and Tate. In Section \ref{sec:Local Class Field Theory} we explain
  applications of these formal modules to local class field theory.
\end{xpl}

\begin{defi}[Formal Module associated to $R$-module]
  \label{def:additiveformalmoduleassociatedtomodule}
  Suppose that $M$ is a finite projective $R$-module. Then we write
  $\Ghat_a \otimes M$ for the additive formal $A$-module associated to $M$ over $R$.
  As a formal scheme, this formal module is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \Ghat_a \otimes M \cong \spf R \llbr M^\vee \rrbr,
  \end{equation*}
  where $R \llbr M^\vee \rrbr$ denotes the completion of $\Sym_R(M^\vee)$ with respect
  to the ideal generated by $M^\vee$. The (formal) $A$-module structure is the
  canonical additive one. 
  Note that $\Lie(\Ghat_a \otimes M) = M$ by design. 
  More generally, if $X$ is a \red{quasi-compact and quasi-separated} $A$-scheme
  and $\cM$ is a finite locally free quasi-coherent 
  $\cO_X$-module, this construction yields a formal $A$-module
  $\Ghat_a \otimes \cM$ over $X$.
\end{defi}
\begin{rmk} 
  If $R\to R'$ is a ring morphism that turns $R'$ into a (say) finite free
$R$ -algebra, the above definition overloads the expression $\Ghat_a \otimes_R R'$.
  In order to disambiguate, we usually denote the additive formal $A$-module
  over $R'$ by $\Ghat_{a, R'}$. 
\end{rmk}

\subsection{Logarithms} % (fold)
\label{sub:Logarithms}
Again, $A$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with uniformizing parameter 
$\varpi$ and finite residue field $k = A/\varpi A$. We write $q$ for the cardinality of 
$k$ and $E$ for the field of fractions of $A$. Let $R$ be a local,
admissible $A$-algebra with structure map $i\colon  A \to R$.

We review results from Sections
2 and 3 of \cite{hopkins1994equivariant}. 
Suppose that $\bF = (F_1, \dots, F_n)$ is a $n$-dimensional formal $A$-module
law over $R$. We abbreviate $\bX = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$, $\bY = (Y_1,
\dots, Y_n)$, etc.

\begin{defi}[Invariant Differentials]
  The module $\omega(\bF)$ of invariant differentials is the submodule of the
  $R$-module of differentials
  \begin{equation*}
    \Omega_{R\llbr T_1, \dots, T_n \rrbr/R} \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n R\llbr T_1, \dots, T_n
    \rrbr \dc T_i,
  \end{equation*}
  consisting of those $\omega \in \omega(\bF)$ satisfying
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:diffcond}
    \omega(\bF(\bX,\bY)) = \omega(\bX) + \omega(\bY)\quad \text{and} \quad
    \omega([a]_\bF(\bX)) = a\omega(\bX).
  \end{equation} 
  for all $a \in A$. 
\end{defi}

It is possible to explicitly calculate a basis for the $R$-module
$\omega(\bF)$, which we now explain. Let 
$$A(\bX, \bY) \in \Mat_{n \times n} (R\llbr \bX, \bY \rrbr)$$ 
denote the matrix $\left((\partial/\partial X_j)F_i (\bX,\bY)\right)_{i,j}$,
the derivative of $\bF(\bX,\bY)$ with respect to $\bX$. Set 
$B(\bY) = A(0,\bY)$. Then $B$ is a unit in $\Mat_{n \times n} R\llbr \bY \rrbr$; 
and we write $(C_{ij}(\bY))$ for the components of 
$B(\bY)^{-1}$. We now construct 
$$\omega_{i} \coloneqq \sum_{j=1}^n C_{ij}(\bX) \dc X_j \in \Omega_{R\llbr \bX \rrbr/R}$$ 
for $1 \leq i \leq n$. By definition we have 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:coeffofcanonicaldiff}
  C_{ij}(0) = \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{ if }i = j,\\
    0 &\text{ otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Checking that $\omega_{i}$ is an invariant differential is a matter of 
applying the chain rule. 
\begin{prop}
    The $R$-module $\omega(\bF)$ is free of rank $n$ generated by invariant differentials
    $\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}, \dots, \omega_{n}$.
\begin{proof}
  This is \cite[Proposition 1.1]{honda1970formalgroups}. 
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
\begin{xpl}
  The invariant differentials for $\Ghat_a$ are spanned by the form $\dc X$. 
  The invariant differentials for $\Ghat_m$ are spanned by the form 
  $\omega_1(X) = \frac 1{1+X} \dc X$.
\end{xpl}
By the Proposition above and Equation \eqref{eq:coeffofcanonicaldiff}, we may
define a pairing
\begin{equation*}
  \omega(\bF) \times \Lie(\bF) \to R, \quad \langle X_i, \omega_j \rangle =
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{ if } i = j,\\
    0 &\text{ otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
This pairing is independent of the parameterization of $\bF$. In particular, it
descends to a pairing defined for formal modules $\cF \in \FMArbOver A R$, and
we have a natural isomorphism $\omega(\cF) \cong \Hom_R(R, \Lie(\cF))$.

Let $\Ghat_a$ be the additive formal $A$-module over $R$. There is a map
\begin{equation} \label{eq:functorinvdifftohom}
  \dc_\bF \colon  \Hom_{\FMLOver AR} (\bF, \Ghat_{a,R}) \to \omega(\bF), \quad f \mapsto \dc f(\bX)
\end{equation}
which is a map of $R$-modules if we equip the left hand side with the $R$-module
structure coming from the natural action of $R \subset \End(\Ghat_a)$. 
\begin{prop}\label{prop:loginvdiff}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If $R$ is a flat $A$-algebra, the map $\dc_F$ is injective.
    \item If $R$ is a $E$-algebra, the map $\dc_F$ is an isomorphism.
  \end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
  This is \cite[Proposition 3.2]{hopkins1994equivariant}.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

Suppose now that $F \in \FMLArbOver A R$ is a formal module law of dimension $n$
over a flat $A$-algebra $R$. 
Let $\omega_1, \dots, \omega_n$ be the distinguished basis for $\omega(F)$
constructed above. 
By the previous proposition, there are unique power series 
$f_i(\bX) \in (R \otimes_A E)\llbr \bX \rrbr$ that furnish homomorphisms
$F \otimes (R \otimes_A E) \to \Ghat_{a,R\otimes_AE}$ of formal $A$-module laws
and satisfying
\begin{equation*}
  \dc_F f_i(\bX) = \omega_i(\bX) \in \omega(F).
\end{equation*}
\begin{defi}[Logarithm and Exponential]
  The induced morphism of formal group laws
  \begin{equation*}
    f = (f_1, \dots, f_n) \colon  F \otimes (R \otimes_A E) \to \Ghat_a^n \otimes_R (R \otimes E)
  \end{equation*}
  is called the logarithm attached to $F$, we write 
  $\log_F(\bX) \in ((R \otimes_A E)\llbr \bX \rrbr)^n$ for the corresponding collection
  of power series. The inverse of $\log_F(\bX)$ is called the exponential 
  attached to $F$, denoted $\exp_F(\bX)$. We have $\Lie(\log_F) = \Lie(\exp_F) = \id$,
  so $\log_F$ and $\exp_F$ are isomorphisms.
\end{defi}

\begin{lem}
  Let $F$ and $G$ be formal $A$-module laws over $R$, with $\dim F = n$ and
  $\dim G = m$. 
  Let $\phi\colon  F \to G$ be a morphism. Then the diagram 
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    {F \otimes(R \otimes_A E)} \& {\Ghat_{a, R\otimes_A E} \otimes (\Lie(F)}
    \otimes_A E) =
    \Ghat_{a, R\otimes_AE}^n \\
    {G \otimes(R \otimes_A E)} \& {\Ghat_{a, R\otimes_A E} \otimes (\Lie(G)} \otimes_A E) =
    \Ghat_{a, R\otimes_AE}^m
  	\arrow["{\log_F}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
  	\arrow["\phi"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
  	\arrow["{\Lie(\phi)}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
  	\arrow["{\log_G}", from=2-1, to=2-2]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commutes. In particular, attached to any $\cF \in \FMArbOver AR$ comes a 
  natural morphism 
  $$\log_\cF\colon  \cF \otimes (R \otimes_A E) \to \Ghat_{a, R\otimes_A E} \otimes
  \left(\Lie(\cF) \otimes_R (R \otimes_A E)\right).$$
  \begin{proof}
    The square commutes because of the equality
    $$\Hom(\Ghat_{a, R\otimes_AE}^n, \Ghat_{a, R\otimes_AE}^m) = \Hom_{R \otimes_A E}((R\otimes_A E)^n, (R\otimes_A E)^m),$$
    and the fact that $\Lie(\log_G \circ \phi \circ \exp_H) = \Lie(\phi).$
  \end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:KernelOfLog}
  Let $E$ be a local field with integers $\cO_E$ and a choice of uniformizer $\varpi \in \cO_E$, 
  and let $F$ be a Lubin-Tate $\cO_E$-module law corresponding to some 
  $f \in \cF_\varpi$, cf. Theorem \ref{thm:LTModLaw}. Let $S$ be an admissible 
  $\cO_E$-algebra and let $s \in S^\cici$ be an element such that the
  series $\log_{\cF}(s)$ 
  converges. Then we have $\log_F(s) = 0$ if and only if $[\varpi]^r_F(s) = 0$ for
  some $r \in \N$. 
\begin{proof}
  Up to canonical isomorphism, $F$ is a $\cO_E$-module law with $[\varpi]_F(T) =
  \varpi T + T^q$. Now one may check that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_F(T) = \lim_{r \to \infty} \frac{ [\varpi]_F^r(T) }{\varpi^r} = \prod_{i=1}^\infty 
    \frac{[\varpi]^i_F(T)}{\varpi [\varpi]^{i-1}_F(T)},
  \end{equation*}
  where convergence is taken coefficient-wise. After inserting
  $s \in S^\cici$, we see that the product vanishes if and only if $[\varpi]_F^r(s) = 0$
  for some $r \in \N$.

\subsection{Formal DVR-Modules over Fields of Finite Characteristic} % (fold)
\label{sub:Formal DVR-Modules over Fields}
As above, let $A$ be a discrete valuation ring with uniformizer $\varpi$ and finite 
residue field $k$; write $q$ for the cardinality of $k$. Let $E$ denote the
field of fractions of $A$, and let $R$ be a $A$-algebra. 

We have seen in the previous section that if $R$ is a field extension of $E$,
then any morphism of formal group laws $f\colon  F \to G$ over $R$ is either $0$
or an isomorphism, which makes the theory of formal $A$-modules over $R$ rather
simple. This situation changes if $R$ is a field extension of $k$: there are
homomorphisms of formal group laws $f\colon F \to G$ corresponding to power
series $f(T) \in R \llbr T \rrbr$ with vanishing differential. The prototype of
such homomorphisms are the relative Frobenii $f \colon F \to F^{(q)}$ corresponding
to the monomial $f(T) = T^q$. Here, of course, $F^{(q)}$ is the formal group
law obtained by raising each coefficient of $F(X,Y) \in R\llbr X, Y\rrbr$ to
the $q$-th power.

We introduce the concept of height, which is in a sense an attempt to quantify
the disorder introduced by the Frobenius homomorphisms. This leads to
interesting invariants of formal $A$-modules over local $A$-algebras $R$.

\begin{defi}[Height of morphisms of group laws]
  Assume that $R$ is a field extension of $k$ and $f\colon  F \to G$ is a morphism of 
  formal groups laws over $R$, given by a formal series $f(T) \in R\llbr T \rrbr$. 
  If $f = 0$, we say that $f$ has infinite height. 
  If $f \neq 0$, the height of $f$ is defined as the largest integer $h$ such that 
  $f = g(T^{q^h})$ for some power series $g(T) = c_1 T + c_2 T^2 + \dots \in
  R\llbr T \rrbr$ with $c_1 \neq 0$. 
\end{defi}
One readily checks that if $f\colon  \cF \to \cG$ is a morphism of formal groups over
a field extension $R$ of $k$, the height of $f$ does not depend on the choices
of group laws on $\cF$ and $\cG$. This allows us to define the height function 
attached to $f$. 
\begin{defi}[Height function]
  Let $f\colon  \cF \to \cG$ be a morphism of formal groups over a scheme $X$.
  For a scheme-theoretic point $x \in \abs X$, let $f_x$ denote the base change of $f$ to the residue field of $x$. 
  The height function attached to $f$ is the upper semicontinuous function.
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:defheight}
    \height(f) \colon  \abs X \to \Z_{\geq 0} \cup \{\infty\}, \quad x \mapsto 
    \height(f_x).
  \end{equation}
\end{defi}
It is not hard to see that the height function is additive, that is, we have
\begin{equation*}
  \height(f \circ g) = \height(f) + \height(g).
\end{equation*}

\begin{defi}[Isogeny]
  A morphism $f\colon  \cF \to \cG$ of formal groups over a field $k$ is called an isogeny if
  $\ker(f)$ is a represented by a finite free $k$-scheme. More generally, a
  morphism of formal $A$-modules over a base scheme $X$ is an isogeny if and
  only if $\ker(f)$ is finite and locally free over $X$. 
\end{defi}

Isogenies can be described using the height function.

\begin{lem}
  A morphism $f\colon  \cF \to \cG$ is a isogeny if and only if the height 
  function $\height(f)$ is locally constant with values in $\Z_{\geq 0}$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{defi}[$\varpi$-divisible $A$-module]
  We say that a formal $A$-module $H$ over $X$ is $\varpi$-divisible if 
  $[\varpi]_H$ is an isogeny. If $X$ is connected, the height of $H$ is the
  (constant) height of the endomorphism $[\varpi]_H\colon  H \to H$. 
\end{defi}

We close this subsection with a discussion about the structure of 
formal $\cO_E$-modules over separably closed field extensions $k'$ of
$k$. 
\begin{prop}\label{prop:classificationofmodulelawsbyheight}
  Over $k'$, any two formal $\cO_E$-module laws of the same height are isomorphic.
\begin{proof}
  \cite[Proposition 1.7]{drinfel1974elliptic}.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
In particular, any formal $\cO_E$-module of height $h$ is isomorphic to 
the normalized formal $\cO_E$-module $F_\mathrm{norm}$. Ths is the
formal $\cO_E$-module with $[\varpi]_{F_\mathrm{norm}}(T) = T^{q^h}$. 
\begin{prop}\label{prop:EndomorphismsOfFormalModulesOverksep}
  Suppose that $F \in \FMLOver {\cO_E}{k'}$. Then $\End_{\FMOver A{k'}}(F)$ is 
  isomorphic to the maximal order
  of the central division algebra $D$ over $E$ of rank $h^2$ and invariant
  $\frac 1h$.
\begin{proof}
  This is part of \cite[Proposition 1.7]{drinfel1974elliptic}
  as well. 
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:inverseqisog}
  Let $f\colon  F \to G$ be an isogeny of $\varpi$-divisible formal $\cO_E$-module laws
  over $k'$. Then there is an 
  integer $n \geq 0$ and an isogeny $g\colon  G \to F$ with 
  \begin{equation*}
    f \circ g = [\varpi^n]_\cG \quad \text{and} \quad g \circ f = [\varpi^n]_\cF.
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{proof}[Proof]
    As the height is additive, we necessarily have 
    $\height(F) = \height(G)$, thus by Lemma
    \ref{prop:classificationofmodulelawsbyheight}, we may assume that $F$ and
    $G$ are given by the normalized formal $\cO_E$-module
    $F_\mathrm{norm}$.
    Write $f(T) = g(T^{q^n})$ for some power series $h(T) = c_1 T + c_2T^2 +
    \dots$, where $c_1 \neq 0$ is a unit in $k'$, and let $g(T) = h^{-1}(T)$ be the 
    formal inverse of $h$. Now $g$ is a morphism of formal $\cO_E$-module laws
    satisfying $f \circ g(T) = g\circ f(T) = T^{q^n}$. The claim follows.
  \end{proof}
\end{lem}

\subsection{Explicit Dieudonné Theory} % (fold)
\label{sub:Explicit Dieudonne Theory}
Let $\cF$ and $\cF'$ be formal $A$-modules of dimension $m$ and $n$ respectively,
over an affine base $\spec R$, coming from formal module laws $F$ and $F'$. We
give an explicit description of $\Ext(\cF, \cF')$ in terms of terms of the
Symmetric 2-Cocycles associated with $F$ and $F'$ (cf. Definition
\ref{def:SymCoc2}). 
We also give a related explicit description of $\RigExt(F, \Ghat_a)$ in terms of 
Quasi-Logarithms, cf. Definition \ref{def:QuasiLogarithm}. 

Write $\bX$ for the variables of $F'$ and $\bZ$ for the variables of $F$.
\begin{defi}[Symmetric $1$-Cochain] \label{def:SymCoc1}
  A symmetric $1$-cochain for the pair $(F,F')$ is an $n$-tuple of power 
  series $\bgg = (g_1, \dots, g_m)$, such that $g_i(\bZ) \in R\llbr \bZ \rrbr$
  satisfying $g_i(0) = 0$ for all $i$. We write $\delta \bgg$ 
  for the coboundary of $\bgg$, that is, the pair $(\Delta \bgg, (\delta_a
  \bgg)_{a \in A})$,
  where
  \begin{equation*}
    \Delta \bgg = \bgg(\bZ_1) -_{F'} \bgg(F(\bZ_1,\bZ_2)) +_{F'} \bgg(\bZ_2)
    \in (R\llbr \bZ_1, \bZ_2 \rrbr)^m
  \end{equation*}
  and 
  \begin{equation*}
    \delta_a \bgg = [a]_{F'} \bgg(\bZ) -_{F'} \bgg([a]_F(\bZ)) \in (R \llbr \bZ
    \rrbr)^m.
  \end{equation*}
  One readily checks that $\delta \bgg \in \SymCoc^2(F, F')$. 
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc}
  Given two extensions $\cE,\cE' \in \Ext(\cF, \cF')$, write 
  $E$, $E'$ for the respective formal $A$-module laws coming from Lemma
  $\ref{lem:SESStandardForm}$, and write
  $\Delta_E$ and $\Delta_{E'}$ for the associated symmetric $2$-cocycles (cf.
  Proposition \ref{prop:ClassOfFGLitoSymCoc}). There is a bijection
  \begin{equation*}
    \{\bgg \in (R\llbr \bZ \rrbr)^m \mid \bgg(0) = 0 \text{ and } \delta \bgg = \Delta_{E'} - \Delta_E\}
    \xto \sim \{\text{Isomorphisms of extensions } E \to E' \}.
  \end{equation*}
  Explicitly, this bijection is given by sending $\bgg$ to the morphism
  $i_\bgg \in \Hom_{\FMLArbOver A R}(E, E')$, given by 
  $i_\bgg (\bX, \bZ) = (\bX +_{F'} \bgg(\bZ), \bZ)$. In particular, there is a bijection
  \begin{equation*}
    \Ext(\cF, \cF') \cong \frac{\SymCoc^2(F, F')}{\{\delta \bgg 
    \mid \bgg \in (R\llbr \bZ \rrbr)^m \text{ with } \bgg(0) = 0\}}.
  \end{equation*}
  This bijection is an isomorphism of $\End(\cF')$-modules.
\end{prop}
For now, this finishes the study of $\Ext(\cF, \cF')$. 

Assume now that $\cF' = \Ghat_a$, and that 
$\cF$ comes from a one-dimensional formal $A$-module $F \in \FMLOver AR$. For
the remainder of this subsection, we will be concerned with the $R$-module
$\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a)$. The notion of Quasi-Logarithms will play a major role.

\begin{defi}[Quasi-Logarithms]\label{def:QuasiLogarithm}
  A power series $g(T) \in (R \otimes_A E) \llbr T \rrbr$ is called a 
  Quasi-Logarithm for $F$, if $g(0) = 0$ and $g'(T)$, as well as all 
  of the power series appearing in $\delta g$ (with $F' = \Ghat_a$, cf.
  Definition \ref{def:SymCoc1})
  have coefficients in $R$. We define the $R$-module
  \begin{equation*}
    \QLog(F) = \frac{\{g(T) \in (R \otimes_A E) \llbr T \rrbr \mid g \text{ is a 
    quasi-logarithm for } F\}}{\{g(T) \in R\llbr T \rrbr \mid g(0) = 0\}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{defi}

Let $(\cE,s) \in \RigExt(F,\Ghat_a)$ be a rigidified extension. 
The splitting $s$ yields an isomorphism $\omega(\cE) \cong \omega(\Ghat_a) \oplus
\omega(\cF)$ on duals, giving an invariant differential $\omega_\cE \in
\omega(\cE)$ pulling back to $\dc X$ on $\Ghat_a$. Conversely, any such invariant
differential $\omega_\cE$ yields a splitting, so the choice of $s$ is
equivalent to the choice of $\omega_E$, and we will henceforth write 
$(\cE, \omega_\cE) \in \RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a)$. 

\begin{thm}[Classification of Rigidified Extensions in terms of Quasi-Logarithms]
  \label{thm:RigExtStr}
  There is a bijection
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:QLogBijection}
    \{\text{Quasi-logarithms for $F$}\} \xto \sim 
      \left\{
      \begin{gathered}
        \text{Pairs $(E, \omega_E)$, where $E$ is an $A$-module law} \\
        \text{fitting into  an exact sequence}
        \\ 0 \to \Ghat_a \xto \alpha E \xto \beta F \to 0 \\
        \text{with $\alpha(X) = (X, 0)$ and $\beta(X, T) = T$ and $\omega_E$} \\
        \text{is an invariant differential on $E$ with 
        $\alpha^* \omega_E = \dc X$.} \\
      \end{gathered}
      \right\}
  \end{equation}
The map sends any quasi-logarithm $g(T) \in (R\otimes_A E)\llbr T \rrbr$
to the pair $(E_{\delta g}, \dc (X + g(T)) \in \RigExt(F, \Ghat_a)$. Here
$E_{\delta g} \in \Ext(F, \Ghat_a)$ is the extension corresponding to 
$\delta g \in \SymCoc^2(F,\Ghat_a)$. 

Furthermore, given two rigidified extensions
$(E, \omega_E), (D, \omega_{D})$ with associated quasi-logarithms
$g(T)$ and $h(T)$, there is a (unique) isomorphism $(E, \omega_E) \to (D, \omega_{D})$
if and only if $h(T)-g(T) =\colon  f(T)$ has coefficients in $R\llbr T \rrbr$. 
In this case, the isomorphism $i_f(X,T) \in \Hom_{\FMLArbOver A R}(E, D)$ is
given by $i_f(X,T) = (X+f(T), T)$. In particular, there is a canonical bijection
\begin{equation*}
  \QLog(F) \xto \sim \RigExt(F, \Ghat_a).
\end{equation*}
This bijection is an isomorphism of $R$-modules.
\begin{proof}[Proof]
  We construct an inverse of the map in \eqref{eq:QLogBijection}. Let $(E,
  \omega_E)$ be an element of the set on the right
  and let $(\Delta, (\delta_a)_{a \in A}) \in
  \SymCoc^2(F, \Ghat_a)$ be the symmetric 2-cochain corresponding to $E$.
  Following Proposition \ref{prop:loginvdiff}, the datum of 
  $\omega_E \in \omega(E)$ is equivalent to a morphism 
  $$f_E \in \Hom_{\FMLOver A {R \otimes E}}(E \otimes_R (R \otimes_A E), \Ghat_a)
  \quad \text{satisfying} \quad f_E(X,T) = X + g(T)$$
  for some $g(T) \in (R \otimes_A E)\llbr T \rrbr$. The fact that 
  $f_E$ is a homomorphism implies that 
  \begin{multline*}
    X_1 + X_2 + \Delta(T_1, T_2) + g(F(T_1,T_2)) = f_E(E((X_1, T_1), (X_2, T_2))) = \\
    = f_E(X_1, T_1) + f_E(X_2, T_2)) = X_1 + g(T_1) + X_2 + g(T_2),
  \end{multline*}
  thereby $\Delta g = \Delta(T_1, T_2) \in R\llbr T_1, T_2\rrbr$. Similarly, 
  we find $\delta_a g = \delta_a \in R\llbr T \rrbr$. Hence, $g(T)$ is a
  quasi-logarithm with $\delta g = (\Delta, (\delta_a)_a)$. 
  This construction yields the desired inverse.
  The remaining statements are verified directly, also cf. \cite[Section
  8]{hopkins1994equivariant}.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

Now, let $A$ be a complete, discrete valuation ring with 
uniformizing parameter $\varpi$ and finite residue field $k$. 
\begin{prop} \label{prop:ExplicitInterestingES}
  Let $\cF$ be a one-dimensional formal $A$-module law over a flat, local
  $A$-algebra $R$, and suppose that $\cF' = \Ghat_a$.
  The short exact sequence of Proposition \ref{prop:InterestingES}
  fits into a commutative diagram with 
  exact rows and vertical maps isomorphisms induced by 
  any choice of coordinate $\cF = \FGG(F)$.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]

    \left\{\begin{gathered} f \in (R\otimes_A E)\llbr T \rrbr : \\ 
  \text{$\delta f = 0$, $f(0) = 0$} \\
    \text{and $f'(T) \in R\llbr T \rrbr$}\end{gathered} \right\} \end{array} \& {\QLog(F)} \&
    {\frac{\SymCoc^2(F, \Ghat_a)}{\{\delta g \mid g \in T R\llbr T \rrbr\}}}

	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["\delta", two heads, from=2-3, to=2-4]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  Injectivity of $\dc_F$ is provided by Proposition \ref{prop:loginvdiff},
  and related to the original exact sequence as $\Hom_R(\Lie(\cF), \Lie(\Ghat_a)) = 
  \omega(\cF)$.
  Surjectivity of $\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a) \to \Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a)$ comes from the
  fact that $\Lie(\cF)$ is projective. 
  The first vertical map is an isomorphism by definition. 
  The vertical arrow describing $\omega(F)$ is obtained by
  identifying the preimage of $\omega(F) \subseteq \omega(F \otimes_R (R
  \otimes_AE))$ under the isomorphism 
  \begin{equation*}
    \{f \in T(R \otimes_A E)\llbr T \rrbr \mid \delta f = 0\} = \Hom_{\FMLOver A
    {R \otimes_A E}} (F \otimes (R \otimes_A E), \Ghat_a) \xto{\dc_F} \omega(F
    \otimes_R (R \otimes_AE)).
  \end{equation*}
  All squares commute by construction.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

We admit the following facts from Section 9 of \cite{hopkins1994equivariant}.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:InterestingSequenceStdMod}
  Let $F$ be a formal $A$-module law of height $h$ over a local, adic
  $A$-algebra $R$. Write $\cF$ for the formal $A$-module coming from 
  $F$. Then $\Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a)$ is a free $R$-module of rank $n-1$, 
  $\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a)$ is a free $R$-module of rank $n$. 
\begin{proof}
  This is Proposition 9.8 in \cite{hopkins1994equivariant}. The authors make
  use of a description of $\Ext(F, \Ghat_a)$ in terms of deformation theory
  and combine it with a convenient normal form of formal $A$-modules, so called
  $A$-typical modules (we touch upon the theory in Section \ref{sub:Hazewinkels
  FuncEq and the Standard Formal Module}), to construct an explicit 
  basis for the corresponding modules. 
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
As a corollary, the authors obtain
\begin{lem}
  If $R \to R'$ is a homomorphism of local $A$-algebras, the induced maps 
  of free $R'$-modules
  \begin{gather*}
    \Ext_R(\cF, \Ghat_a) \otimes_R R' \to \Ext_{R'}(\cF, \Ghat_a) \\
    \RigExt_R(\cF, \Ghat_a) \otimes_R R' \to \RigExt_{R'}(\cF, \Ghat_a)
  \end{gather*}
  are isomorphisms.
\begin{proof}

\begin{defi}[The Dieudonn\'e module of a formal $A$-module]\label{def:DioModule}

\subsection{Hazewinkel's Functional Equation Lemma and the Standard Formal Module Law} % (fold)
\label{sub:Hazewinkels FuncEq and the Standard Formal Module}
If, $A$ is an integral domain and $R$ is a flat $A$-module, the structure of a formal
$A$-module $F$ over $R$ is uniquely determined by its logarithm $\log_H
\in R \otimes_A E \llbr T \rrbr$. Indeed, we find
\begin{equation*}
  F(X,Y) = \exp_H(X+Y), \quad [a]_F(X) = \exp_H(a X).
\end{equation*}
It is therefore natural to wonder about conditions on power series $f \in
(R\otimes_A E) \llbr T \rrbr$ ensuring that $f$ is the logarithm of some
formal group law. Hazewinkel found such a condition in his functional equation
lemma.

\begin{thm}[Hazewinkel's Functional Equation Lemma]\label{thm:HazewinkelIntegrality}
  Let $p$ be a prime and $q = p^e$. Given an inclusion of rings $B \subseteq
  L$, an ideal $\fa \subseteq B$ containing $p$, an endomorphism of rings
  $\sigma\colon  L \to L$ and elements $s_1, s_2, \dots \in L$ subject to the conditions
  that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \sigma(b) \equiv b^q \pmod \fa \text{ for all } b \in B \quad \text{and} \quad 
    \sigma^r(s_i) \fa \subset B \text{ for all } r,s \geq 1.
  \end{equation*}
  Suppose now that $f \in L\llbr T \rrbr$ has $f'(0) \in L^\times$ and
  satisfies the functional equation condition
  \begin{equation*}
    f(X) - \sum_{i=1}^\infty s_i (\sigma^i_* f)(X^{q^i}) \in B\llbr X \rrbr.
  \end{equation*}
  Then we have 
  \begin{equation*}
    F(X,Y) = f^{-1}(f(X) + f(Y)) \in B \llbr X,Y \rrbr,
  \end{equation*}
  where $f^{-1}$ is the inverse power series as in Lemma \ref{lem:IsosCheckOnLie}.
  Also, if $g(Z) \in L\llbr Z \rrbr$ is another power series satisfying the 
  same condition
  \begin{equation*}
    g(Z) - \sum_{i=1}^\infty s_i (\sigma^i_* f)(Z^{q^i}) \in B\llbr Z \rrbr,
  \end{equation*}
  then $f^{-1}(g(Z)) \in B\llbr Z \rrbr$. 
  Furthermore, if $\alpha(T) \in B\llbr T \rrbr$ and $\beta(T) \in B \llbr T \rrbr$, then
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:funceqlemcongruence}
    \alpha(T) \equiv \beta(T) \pmod {\fa^r} \iff f(\alpha(T)) \equiv f(\beta(T))
    \pmod {\fa^r}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{proof}
    A more general statement can be found in \cite[Section
    2]{hazewinkel1979funceqexp}. Proofs can be found in \cite[Sections 2 and
    10]{hazewinkel1978formal}.
  \end{proof}
\end{thm}
Note that by construction, $F(X,Y)$ as defined above yields a (commutative)
formal group law over $B$. 
Let $B^\sigma$ denote the subring of elements in $B$ fixed by $\sigma$. Then 
the second part of the Functional Equation Lemma implies that we even obtain
formal $B^\sigma$-modules with $[b]_F(T) = f^{-1}(b f(T))$, as $bf(T)$
satisfies the same functional equation if $b \in B^\sigma$. 

We now enter the situation where $E$ is a local field with ring of integers
$\cO_E$ and uniformizer $\varpi$ and 
use the Functional Equation Lemma to construct Lubin--Tate Formal Group Laws. 
A special role will play the power series
\begin{equation*}
  f(T) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{T^{q^{in}}}{\varpi^i} \in E\llbr T \rrbr.
\end{equation*}
It satisfies the functional equation
\begin{equation*}
  f(T) = T + \frac 1\varpi f(T^{q^n}),
\end{equation*}
which is a functional equation of the form above, with 
$B = \cO_E$, $\fa = (\varpi)$, $L = E$, $s_1 = \varpi^{-1}$, $s_2 = s_3 = \dots = 0$,
$\sigma = \id_L$. 
Hence $f$ arises as the logarithm of a formal $\cO_E$-module law $H$ over $\cO_E$.
The fact that $f^{-1}(X) = X - \frac 1\varpi X^{q^n} + \dots$ reveals
$[\varpi]_H(T) \equiv \varpi T$ mod $(T^2)$. Additionally, note that 
\begin{equation*}
  f([\varpi]_H(T)) = \varpi f(T) = \varpi T + f(T^{q^n}) \equiv f(T^{q^n}) \pmod \varpi.
\end{equation*}
Hence, the equivalence in \eqref{eq:funceqlemcongruence} implies that 
$[\varpi]_H(T) \equiv T^{q^n}$ mod $\varpi$. So $H$ is a Lubin--Tate formal $\cO_E$-module
law of height $n$, we call it the standard Lubin--Tate formal module law of
height $n$. 
\begin{rmk} 
  The formal $\cO_E$-module $H$ is a member of the class of so called $A$-typical
  formal modules - formal $A$-modules $F$ with logarithm of the 
  form
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_F(T) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty b_i X^{q^i}
  \end{equation*}
  for elements $b_0, b_1, \dots \in R \otimes_A E$ (cf. \cite[Definition
  21.5.5 and Criterion 21.5.9]{hazewinkel1978formal}). If $R$ is flat over $A$,
  every formal $A$-module over $R$ is isomorphic to an $A$-typical one
  (cf. \cite[21.5.6]{hazewinkel1978formal}). Most results about the standard
  $\cO_E$-module $H$ remain true for general $\cO_E$-typical formal module laws.
\end{rmk}

We note the following. 
\begin{lem}\label{lem:MultByROUForStandardModule}
  Let $H$ be the standard formal $\cO_E$-module of height $n$ over 
  $\cO_\br E$. 
  Let $\zeta \in \br E$ be a $(q^n-1)$-th root of unity. Then 
  $[\zeta]_H(T) = \zeta T$ is an automorphism of $H$. In particular,
  $\End(H)$ naturally carries the structure of a $\cO_{E_n}$-algebra,
  where $E_n$ is the unramified extension of $E$ with residue field
  $\FF_{q^n}$. 
\begin{proof}
  This is an immediate consequence of the equality $\zeta \log_H(T)
  = \log_H(\zeta T)$. We have
  \begin{equation*}
    \zeta T = \exp_H(\log_H(\zeta T)) = \exp_H(\zeta \log_H(T)) = \exp_H
    ([\zeta]_{\Ghat_{a, \br E}}(\log_H(T))).
  \end{equation*}
  As $\exp_H\colon  \Ghat_{a, \br E} \to H \otimes_{\cO_\br E} \br E$ is an isomorphism of 
  formal modules, the claim follows.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

It will be convenient to make the terms in the exact sequence of Proposition 
\ref{prop:ExplicitInterestingES} explicit for $\cF = \FGG(H)$. As $H$ is of height $n>0$, 
there is no non-trivial map $H \to \Ghat_a$ and the sequence becomes
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	0 \& {\omega(H)} \& {\RigExt(H,\Ghat_a)} \& {\Ext(H,\Ghat_a)} \& 0 \\
	0 \& \begin{array}{c} \left\{\begin{gathered} {g \in TE\llbr T \rrbr : \delta g = 0} \\          \text{ and $g'(T) \in \cO_E\llbr T \rrbr$}\end{gathered} \right\} \end{array} \& {\QLog(H)} \& {\frac{\SymCoc^2(H, \Ghat_a)}{\{\delta g \mid g \in T \cO_E\llbr T \rrbr\}}} \& 0.

	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]

	\arrow["\delta", from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
\end{tikzcd}   
\end{equation*}
This allows us to formulate the following result.
\begin{prop}
  The $R$-module $\omega(H)$ is free of rank $1$, generated by 
  $f(T) = \log_H(T)$. $\QLog(H)$ is free of rank $n$, generated by the classes of
  $(f(T), \frac 1\varpi f(T^q), \dots, \frac 1\varpi f(T^{q^{n-1}}))$. Consequently,
  the short exact sequence above is given by 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \left \langle f(T) \right \rangle \to \left \langle f(T), \frac 1\varpi
      f(T^q) , \dots,
    \frac 1\varpi f(T^{q^{n-1}}) \right \rangle \xto \delta 
    \left \langle \delta \left(\frac 1\varpi f(T^q)\right),\dots, \delta
    \left(\frac 1\varpi f(T^{q^{n-1}})\right ) \right \rangle \to 0.
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  A simple calculation shows that $\frac 1\varpi f(T^{q^k})$ is a quasi-logarithm for 
  $1 \leq k \leq n-1$. As $\delta f = 0$, we have $f(T) \in \QLog(F)$ as well. 
  The claim is \cite[Proposition 13.8]{hopkins1994equivariant} which is a 
  special case of [ibid., Proposition 9.8].
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\subsection{The Universal Additive Extension} % (fold)
\label{sub:The Universal Additive Extension}
We follow \cite[Section 11]{hopkins1994equivariant}, 
and specialize to the situation where $A$ is a complete discrete valuation ring
with uniformizer $\varpi$ and finite residue field of characteristic $p$ and
$R$ is a local admissible $A$-algebra with residue field $\bar \FF_q$.

\begin{lem}
  Let $M$ be a finite free module over $R$. Then there is a natural bijection,
  functorial in $M$ and $\cF$
  \begin{equation*}
    \Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a \otimes M) \cong \Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a) \otimes_R M.
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  After choosing coordinates on $\cF$, this follows directly from the 
  description of $\Ext$ in terms of symmetric 2-cocycles, cf. Propositions
  \ref{prop:ClassOfFGLitoSymCoc} and \ref{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc}.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

Let $\cF$ be a one-dimensional formal $A$-module over $R$.
We put $\mathrm M(\cF) \coloneqq \Hom_R(\Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a), R)$, which is free of
rank $n-1$, and
write $\cV = \Ghat_a \otimes \mathrm M(\cF)$. Now, by the previous lemma,
\begin{equation*}
  \Ext(\cF,\cV) = \Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a \otimes \mathrm M(\cF)) = \End_R(\Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a)). 
\end{equation*}
Let $0 \to \cV \to \cE \to \cF \to 0$ be the extension corresponding to the identity 
on the right. This class is unique up to unique isomorphism. Indeed, 
as $R$ is a local ring we may choose formal module laws $F$ and $V$ giving rise
to $\cF$ and $\cV$, and let $E$ be the module law obtained from 
Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}. 
If $0 \to V \to E' \to F \to 0$ is another extension in this class, we
have by construction a commutative square
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	0 \& {V} \& E \& F \& 0 \\
	0 \& {V} \& {E'} \& F \& 0,
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]

	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
and by Proposition \ref{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc} we see that 
any other isomorphism $i'$ making the diagram above commute differs from
$i$ by an element in $\Hom(F, V) = 0$. 

\begin{defi}[Universal Additive Extension]
  The extension
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cV \to \cE \to \cF \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  constructed above is called the universal additive extension of $\cF$.
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}
  If $N$ is a finite, free $R$-module, $\cG' = \Ghat_a \otimes N$ and 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cG' \to \cE' \to F \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  is an extension of $\cF$ by $\cG'$, there are unique homomorphisms
    $i\colon  \cE \to \cE'$ and $g'\colon  \cV \to \cG'$ making the diagram
  \begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	0 \& {\cV} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0 \\

	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
\end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commute. In particular, we have $\cE' = g'_* \cE$. 
\begin{proof}
  As $\cV$ and $\cG'$ are additive, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \Hom(\cV, \cG') = \Hom_R(\mathrm M(\cF), N) = \Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a) \otimes N =
    \Ext(\cF, \cG').
  \end{equation*}
  This yields $g'$. Again, $i$ is unique as by observations similar to 
  Proposition \ref{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc}, the difference of two
  morphisms $i,i'\colon \cE \to \cE'$ is given a morphism $\cF \to \cG'$, which has
  to be trivial.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:LieAlgOfUnivAddExt}
  There is a natural isomorphism $\Lie(\cE) \xto \sim \Hom(\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a), R) 
  = \Dio(\cF)$.
\begin{proof}
  We show the equivalent statement $\omega(\cE) = \RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a)$. 
  Let $(\cE', \omega_{\cE'}) \in \RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a)$. Then by universality of 
  $\cE$, we obtain a unique homomorphism $i\colon  \cE \to \cE'$. This yields a 
  homomorphism of $R$-modules $\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a) \to \omega(\cE)$, 
  sending a pair $(\cE', \omega_{\cE'})$ to $i^*\omega_{\cE'}$. This morphism
  fits into the following commutative diagram, where the top row is 
  the short exact sequence from Proposition \ref{prop:ExplicitInterestingES}
  and the bottom row is the dual short exact sequence of 
  $0 \to \Lie(\cV) \to \Lie(\cE) \to \Lie(\cF) \to 0$.
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
  	0 \& {\omega(\cF)} \& {\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a)} \& {\Ext(\cF, \Ghat_a)} \& 0 \\

  	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
  	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  Thereby, $\RigExt(\cF, \Ghat_a) \to \omega(\cE)$ is a natural isomorphism.

\subsection{Determinants of Formal modules} % (fold)
\label{sub:Determinants of Formal modules}
In \cite{hedayatzadeh2015det}, Hedayatzadeh constructs determinants of 
$\varpi$-divisible formal $\cO_E$-modules over \red{properties} rings. 
We cite the result of main importance for us.
\begin{thm}[Determinants of Formal Modules]\label{thm:HedayatzadehsResult}
  ABCDE
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

Let $\cF_0 \in \FMOver {\cO_E}{\Fqbar}$ be a formal module of height $n$ and 
write $\wedge^n\cF_0$ for the associated determinant module, that is, the 
formal $\cO_E$ module with $\Dio(\wedge^n\cF_0) = \wedge^n\Dio(\cF_0)$. Write
$\cM_m$ for the Deformation space of $\cF_0$ with Drinfeld level
$\varpi^m$-structure, and write $\cM_{m, \wedge}$ for the deformation space of
$\wedge^n\cF$. 
Following \cite{weinstein2016semistable}, we sketch how this result can be
used to construct a functor $\cM_{m} \to \cM_{m, \wedge}$. 

For $R\in\cC$ and $(\cF, \iota) \in \cM_{0}(R)$, we write $\delta_m$ for the
induced universal multilinear and alternating morphisms
\begin{equation}\label{eq:determinantontorsionpoints}
  \delta_m \colon \cF[\varpi^m]^n \to \wedge^n\cF[\varpi^m].
\end{equation}

We now have the following result.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:DeterminantOfDrinfeldStructure}
  Let $(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \cF[\varpi^{m}]^n(R)$ be a Drinfeld level
  $\varpi^m$ structure. Then 
  \begin{equation*}
    \delta_m(x_1, \dots, x_n) \in \wedge^n\cF[\varpi^m](R) 
  \end{equation*}
  is a Drinfeld level $\varpi^m$ structure.
\begin{proof}
  This is \cite[Proposition 2.11]{weinstein2016semistable}.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

In particular, we obtain the desired map

\begin{equation*}
  \cM_m^{(0)}(R) \to \cM^{(0)}_{m, \wedge}(R), \quad (\cF, \iota, \phi)
  \mapsto (\wedge^n \cF, \wedge^n \iota, \delta_m \circ \phi).
\end{equation*}

We also need the following result.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:WeinsteinDeterminantAndNorm}
  Let $L/E$ be a separable extension of degree $n$ and suppose that there 
  is an action $\cO_L \inj \End(\cF)$ turning $\cF$ into a formal
  $\cO_L$-module of height $1$. Then, for all $m \geq 1$, the identity
  \begin{equation*}
    \delta_m(\alpha x_1, \dots, \alpha x_n) = \Norm_{L/E}(\alpha) \delta_m
    (x_1, \dots, x_n)
  \end{equation*}
  holds. 
  \begin{proof}
    This is \cite[Lemma 2.12]{weinstein2016semistable}.
  \end{proof}
\end{lem}

We remark that the Lemma above in particular applies to the standard formal 
$\cO_E$-module $H$ over $\cO_\br E$. We turn our attention to the determinant of the standard
formal $\cO_E$-module in the following example.

\begin{xpl}
  The determinant $\wedge^n H$ is the formal $\cO_E$-module law over 
  $\cO_\br E$ with logarithm given by the power series
  \begin{equation*}
    f_\wedge(T) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (-1)^{(n-1)i} \frac{T^{q^i}}{\varpi^i}.
  \end{equation*}
  This is to be understood in the following way. If $\cH$ is a formal module
  equipped with a coordinate $\cH \cong \spf(\cO_\br E \llbr T \rrbr)$ inducing an 
  isomorphism $\cH \cong \FGG(H)$, then the same coordinate yields 
  an isomorphism $\wedge^n \cH \cong \FGG(\wedge H)$. We do not prove this,
  but we note that it can be witnessed on the
  corresponding Dieuodonn\'e-modules: $\Dio(\wedge^n H)$ and 
  $\wedge^n \Dio(H)$ are naturally isomorphic. The module $\QLog(\wedge^n H)$
  is
  generated by $f_\wedge(T)$, and $\wedge^n \QLog(H)$ is generated by the element
  \begin{equation*}
    w(T) = \log_H(T) \wedge \frac 1\varpi \log_H(T^q) \wedge \dots \wedge \frac 1\varpi \log_H(T^{q^{n-1}}) \in \wedge^n \Dio(H).
  \end{equation*}
  We have $f_\wedge(T^q) = (-1)^{n-1} \varpi f(T) - \varpi T$, which equals
  $(-1)^{n-1}\varpi f_\wedge(T)$ in $\QLog(\wedge^n H) \cong \Dio(\wedge^n
  H)^\vee$. 
  This readily implies
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi(w) = w(T^q) = (-1)^{n-1} \varpi w(T) \quad \text{and} \quad
    \phi(f_\wedge(T)) = f_\wedge(T^q) = (-1)^{n-1}\varpi f_\wedge(T).
  \end{equation*}
  Thereby, $\Dio(\wedge^n H)$ and $\wedge^n \Dio(H)$ are free of rank one
  with isomorphic Frobenius structure, hence isomorphic as Dieudonn\'e-modules.
  We also note that by Theorem \ref{thm:HazewinkelIntegrality}, one finds
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:detformalmodulevarpiexpl}
    [\varpi]_{(\wedge^n H)_0}(T) = (-1)^{n-1} T^q.
  \end{equation}
\end{xpl}

\subsection{The Universal Cover} % (fold)
\label{sub:Tate Modules and the Universal Cover} 

% Subintro (fold)
Assume that $A$ is a discrete valuation ring with uniformizer
$\varpi$, finite residue field $k$ and fraction field $K$. 
Write $q = \# k$. Let $R$ be an admissible $A$-algebra admitting an ideal of definition
$I$ with $R/I = \Fqbar$. Let $\cF$ be a formal
$\varpi$-divisible $A$-module over $R$ of height $n$. 
\begin{defi}[The Universal Cover]
  We denote by $\tilde \cF$ the functor
  \begin{equation*}
    \Tilde \cF \colon \Adm R \to \Vec {K}, \quad
    S \mapsto \left\{(x_1, x_2, \dots) \in \prod_{\N} \cF(S) \mid \varpi (x_{i+1}) =
    x_i \right\}.
  \end{equation*}
  Note that for $S \in \Adm R$, the set $\Tilde \cF(S)$ has a natural
  $A$-module structure with multiplication by $\varpi$ an isomorphism, making
  it a $K$-vector space.
\end{defi}

We remark that the Tate module
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TateModuleDef}
  T_\varpi \cF \colon \Adm R \to \Mod A, \quad S \mapsto \{(x_1, x_2, \dots)
  \in \tilde \cF \mid \varpi x_1 = 0\}

\end{equation}
arise as subfunctors of $\Tilde \cF$. 
% Subintro (end)

\subsubsection{Useful Calculations} % (fold)
\label{ssub:Useful Calculations}
Let $p$ be a prime. Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal $I$
such that $p \in I$, $R$ is complete with respect to the $I$-adic topology and
$k_R \coloneqq R/I$ is an algebraically closed field (necessarily of
characteristic $p$). If $q$ is a power of $p$, we write $\cP_{R,q}$ for the set
of power series $f \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ satisfying 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:condonpowerseries}
  f(T) \equiv g(T^q) \pmod I
\end{equation}
for some power series $g(T) = c_1 T + c_2 T^2 + \dots \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ with 
$c_1 \in R^\times$. 
If $q'>q$ is another power of $p$, we have injections $\cP_{R,q} \inj \cP_{R,q'}$
given by sending $f(T)$ to its $(q'/q)$-fold self-composite $f^{q'/q}(T)$. 
Making use of these transition maps, we define
\begin{equation*}
  \cP_R \coloneqq \colim_{n \in \N} \cP_{R, p^n},
\end{equation*}
identifying any power series $f \in \cP_{R,q}$ with its image in $\cP_{R,q'}$ for 
higher $p$-powers $q'$. 
For any $f \in \cP_{R,q}$, we define the functor
\begin{equation*}
  U_f: \Adm R \to \Set, \quad S \mapsto \left\{(x_0,x_1, \dots) \in \prod_\N S^\cici 
                                          \mid f(x_{i+1}) = x_i\right\}.
\end{equation*}
This functor does, up to canonical isomorphism, only depend on the equivalence
class of $f$ in $\cP_R$. 
We write $U_{0,f}$ for the base change of $U_f$ to $k_R$, that is
\begin{equation*}
  U_{0,f}: \Adm {k_R} \to \Set, \quad S \mapsto \left\{(x_0,x_1, \dots) \in
                              \prod_\N S^\cici \mid \bar f(x_{i+1}) = x_i\right\}.
\end{equation*}
Here, $\bar f$ is the image of $f$ under the reduction map $R\llbr T \rrbr \to
k_R\llbr T \rrbr$. 

In the sequel, we denote $R$-algebras by $S$ and write $J$ for an ideal
of definition containing the image of $I$ (provided, for example, by \ref{lem:iodimage}).
Given an element $f\in \cP_R$, we do not distinguish between $f$ and a choice of a 
representative $\tilde f \in \cP_{R,q}$ for some sufficiently large $p$-power.

The following observation lays the groundwork for many of the upcoming results.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:cryscalc}
  Let $f$ be any power series in $\cP_R$. For any two elements $s_1,s_2 \in S$ 
  with $s_1 \equiv s_2 \mod J$ such that $f(s_1)$ and $f(s_2)$ exist (for
  example if $f$ is a polynomial or $s_1, s_2 \in S^\cici$), we have 
  \begin{equation*}
    f^k(s_1) \equiv f^k(s_2) \pmod {J^{k+1}}.
  \end{equation*}
  Here, $f^k$ denotes $k$-fold composition of $f$.
\begin{proof}
  We will show that if $s_1 \equiv s_2$ mod $J^k$, then $f(s_1) \equiv f(s_2)$ mod 
  $J^{k+1}$, which suffices to prove the claim. 
  We may write $s_2 = s_1 + r$ for some $r\in J^k$. By the assumptions on $f$
  there exist power series 
  $g,h \in R\llbr T \rrbr$ such that $h$ only
  has coefficients in $I$ and $f(T) = g(T^q) + h(T)$. As $I$ is finitely generated,
  say by elements $(r_1, \dots, r_l)$, we obtain a representation 
  \begin{equation*}
    f(s_1) - f(s_2) = g(s_1^{q})-g(s_2^{q}) + \sum_{i=1}^l r_i \left(h_i(s_1) -
    h_i(s_2)\right).
  \end{equation*}
  As $r$ divides $\left(h_i(s_1) - h_i(s_2)\right)$, we find
  $r_i(h_i(s_1) - h_i(s_2)) \in (r_i r) \subseteq J^{k+1}$. Also note that 
  for any $s\in S$ and $n \in \N$, 
  $$(s+r)^{nq} = s^{nq} + nqrs^{nq-1}r + \dots + r^{nq},$$
  so after cancellation, all monomials of $g(s_1^q) - g(s_2^q)$ lie in
  $(qr)$ or $(r^2)$. This implies
  \begin{equation*}
    g(s_1^q) - g\left((s_1+r)^q\right) \in (qr) + (r^2) \subseteq J^{k+1},
  \end{equation*}
  and we are done.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:reductioniso}
  The natural reduction map 
  \begin{equation*}
    U_f(S) \to U_{f}(S/J) = U_{0,f}(S/J) 
  \end{equation*}
  is bijective.
\begin{proof}
  We first show surjectivity. Given a sequence $(x_0, x_1, \dots) \in U_{f}(S/J)$, 
  we can choose a sequence of arbitrary lifts $(y_0, y_1, \dots ) \in \prod_\N
  S^\cici$ and set 
  \begin{equation*}
    z_i = \lim_{r \to \infty} f^r(y_{i+r}).
  \end{equation*}
  The limit exists, because if $s\geq r$ are two non-negative integers, we calculate
  \begin{equation*}
    f^{s-r}(y_{i+s}) \equiv \bar f^{s-r}(x_{i+s}) = x_{i+r} \equiv y_{i+r}
    \pmod J,
  \end{equation*}
  implying by Lemma \ref{lem:cryscalc} that 
  \begin{equation*}
    f^{s}(y_{i+s}) \equiv f^r(y_{i+r}) \pmod{J^r}.
  \end{equation*}
  This shows that $(f^{r}(y_{i+r}))_{r \in \N}$ is a Cauchy-sequence for the 
  $J$-adic topology on $S$, thereby convergent (cf. Lemma
  \ref{lem:AdmAdicComp}). The sequence $(z_0, z_1, \dots)$ now lies in $U_f(S)$
  and lifts $(x_0, x_1, \dots)$. It remains to show that the lift is unique.
  Suppose that $(z'_0, z'_1, \dots)$ is another lift. Then, for any $i,k \in\N$
  we have $z_{i+k} \equiv z'_{i+k}$ mod $J$, and another application of Lemma
  \ref{lem:cryscalc} shows that 
  \begin{equation*}
    z_i = f^k(z_{i+k}) \equiv f^k(z'_{i+k}) = z'_i \pmod {J^k}.
  \end{equation*}
  Thereby $(z_i - z'_i) \in \bigcap_{k \in \N} J^k = \{0\}$. Hence,
  the lift is unique.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

We write $\Nilp^\flat$ for the functor $U_{T^q}$. That is, 
$\Nilp^\flat(S) = \lim_{x \mapsto x^q}S^\cici$ is 
the set of $q$-power compatible sequences with values in $S^\cici$. 

\begin{lem}\label{lem:nilp0iso}
  For any $f \in \cP_R$, there is a canonical \todo{Use different $S$}
  bijection $U_{0,f}(S/J) \to \Nilp^\flat(S/J)$. This bijection is functorial in 
  $S$.
\begin{proof}
  By assumption on $f$ we have $f(T) = g(T^{q}) \in k_R\llbr T \rrbr$ for some 
  $g(T) = c_1T + c_2T^2 + \dots$ with $c_1 \neq 0$. For each coefficient $c_i$, let
  $d_i \in k_R$ be the unique element such that $d_i^{q} = c_i$. Let
  $h(T) \in k_R\llbr T \rrbr$ be the power series given by $d_1 T + d_2
  T^2 + \dots$. Now $(h(T))^{q}=f(T)$, and we find that 
  \begin{equation*}
      U_f(S/J) \to \Nilp^\flat(S/J): \quad
      (x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots) \mapsto (x_1, h(x_2), h(h(x_3)), \dots)
  \end{equation*}
  is a well-defined function, and functorial in $S$. For the
  inverse, let $h^{-1}(T) \in k_R\llbr T \rrbr$ be the unique power
  series with $h^{-1}(h(T))= h(h^{-1}(T)) = T$, see Lemma
  \ref{lem:IsosCheckOnLie}. The map
  \begin{equation*}
      \Nilp^\flat(S/J) \to U_f(S/J), \quad 
      (x_1, x_2, \dots ) \mapsto (x_1, h^{-1}(x_2), h^{-1}(h^{-1}(x_3)), \dots)
  \end{equation*}
  is well-defined as
  \begin{equation*}
      f(h^{-1}(T)) = g((h^{-1}(T))^{q}) = (h(h^{-1}(T)))^{q} =
      T^{q},
  \end{equation*}
  and it is readily seen to be inverse to the map constructed above.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

We collect results.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:pHTcalc}
  Given $f,g \in \cP_R$, we have bijections, functorial in $S$,
  \begin{equation} 
    U_f(S) \to U_f(S/J) \to \Nilp^\flat(S/J) \to U_g(S/J) \to U_g(S).
  \end{equation}
  Explicitly, the bijection $U_f(S) \to U_g(S)$ can be described as follows.
  Suppose that $f,g \in \cP_{R,q}$ for some sufficiently large $q$. 
  Let $h_f(T)$ and $h_g(T)$ be power series with coefficients in $A$ such that 
  $$h_f(T)^q \equiv f(T) \pmod I\quad\text{and}\quad h_g(T)^q \equiv g(T) \pmod
  I.$$
  Write $h_g^{-1}(T)$ for the (formal) inverse power series of $h_g$. 
  Now the isomorphism is given by the mapping
  \begin{equation*}
    (x_0, x_1, \dots) \mapsto (y_0, y_1, \dots), \quad \text{where} \quad y_i =
    \lim_{r \to \infty} g^r(h_g^{-(r+i)}(h_f^{r+i} (x_{i+r}))).
  \end{equation*}
  Here, the exponents are to be interpreted as iterated composition.
\begin{proof}
  The first part follows directly from repeated application of the previous
  two Lemmas. The second part follows by tracing through the previous lemmas.

\subsubsection{Applications to the Universal Cover} % (fold)
\label{ssub:The Universal Cover}

Fix a coordinate $\cF \cong \spf(R\llbr T \rrbr)$ so that $\cF = \FGG(F)$ for
some $A$-module law $F \in \FMLOver AR$. Then $[\varpi]_F(T) \in \cP_R$, and
we obtain an isomorphism $\tilde \cF \cong U_{[\varpi]_F} \eqqcolon \tilde F$.
Write $F_0 = F \otimes k_R$, and $\tilde F_0 = U_{0, [\varpi]_F}$. 

\begin{lem}
  We have an isomorphism 
  \begin{equation*}
    \tilde \cF_0 \cong \Nilp^\flat_{k_R}
  \end{equation*}
  of functors $\Adm {k_R} \to \Set$
  \begin{proof}
    Any lift of $[\varpi]_{F_0}(T) \in k_R\llbr T \rrbr$ lies inside $\cP_R$. Hence,
    the statement is an application of Lemma \ref{lem:nilp0iso}.
  \end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
  Suppose that $S$ is an admissible $R$-algebra admitting an ideal of definition
  $J$ such that $\varpi \in J$. Then the natural reduction map
  \begin{equation*}
    \tilde \cF(S) \to \tilde \cF(S/J) = \tilde \cF_0(S/J)
  \end{equation*}
  is an isomorphism.
  \begin{proof}[Proof]
    After choosing a coordinate $\cF = \FGG(F)$, we have $[\varpi]_F \in \cP_R$
    and hence $\tilde \cF(S) \cong U_{[\varpi]_F}$. Thereby the statement is
    given by Lemma \ref{lem:reductioniso}.
  \end{proof}
\end{lem}

The following is analogous to Proposition \ref{prop:pHTcalc}.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:UnivCoverReductionIso}
  Let $S$ be an admissible $R$-algebra with ideal of definition $J$ such that 
  $\phi(I) \subseteq J$. Then there are canonical isomorphisms (of sets)
  \begin{equation*}
    \tilde \cF(S) \cong \tilde \cF(S/J) = \tilde \cF_0(S/J) \cong \Nilp^\flat(S/J) \cong
    \Nilp^\flat(S).
  \end{equation*}
  In particular, $\tilde \cF(S)$ is, as a functor to $\Set$, representable by
  $\spf(R \llbr T^{q^{-\infty}} \rrbr)$.
\end{prop}
We write $\lambda$ for the isomorphism $\Tilde \cF \to \Nilp^\flat$, and
$\lambda_i: \Tilde \cF \to (-)^\cici$ for projection on the $i$-th component.
Similarly, we write $\mu: \Nilp^\flat \to \Tilde \cF$ for the inverse of 
$\lambda$ and $\mu_i$ for the $i$-th component of $\mu$. 

By the proposition above, quasi-isogenies on $\cF_0$ induce isomorphisms on 
$\tilde \cF$. This will be used to construct an action of $D^\times$ on 
$\tilde \cF$ below. 
The relative Frobenius morphism lifts as well.
\begin{defi}[Relative Frobenius on $\Tilde \cF$] \label{def:FrobOnUnivCov}
  Write $\Pi: \Tilde \cF \to \Phi^{-1,*}\Tilde \cF$ for the isomorphism coming from
  the Frobenius quasi-isogeny 
  \begin{equation*}
    \Frob_q: \cF_0 \to \cF_0^{(q)} = \Phi^{-1,*} \cF_0.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defi}

We finally note the following auxiliary result.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:UnivCoverIsRatTateifDiscrete}
  Let $S$ be a discrete admissible $R$-algebra. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    V_\varpi \cF(S) = \tilde \cF(S).
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  As $S$ is discrete, each $s \in S^\cici$ is nilpotent. From here it is easy to 
  see that there is some $m \in \N$ such that $[\varpi^m]_F(s) = 0$. The desired 
  statement follows directly.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Quasilogarithm Map} % (fold)
\label{sub:The Quasilogarithm map}
We keep the assumptions on $A$, $R$ and $S$ from the previous subsection. That is,
$A$ is a local ring with finite residue field and uniformizer $\varpi$, 
$R$ is a local $A$-algebra with maximal ideal $I$ complete with respect to
the $I$-adic topology and algebraically closed residue field $k_R$, and 
$S$ denotes an admissible $R$-algebra (where $R \to S$ is continuous with
the $I$-adic topology on $R$) with ideal of definition $J \subseteq S$ containing
the image of $I$. 

The aim of this subsection is to define, attached to any $\varpi$-divisible formal
$A$-module $\cF$ over $R$, a map
\begin{equation*}
\qlog_\cF: \tilde \cF(S) \to \Dio(\cF) \otimes_R (S \otimes_A K),
\end{equation*}
called the quasi-logarithm map.
We give an explicit description of this map if $\cF = \FGG(H)$ is the standard
$\cO_K$-module over $\cO_{\breve K}$. 

The construction of $\qlog_\cF$ is as follows.  
Let $0 \to \cV \xto\psi \cE \xto\phi \cF \to 0$ be the universal additive
extension of $\cF$. For any sequence $(x_1, x_2, \dots) \in \tilde \cF(S)$, choose an arbitrary sequence $(y_1, y_2, \dots) \in
\tilde \cE(S)$ such that $y_i$ is a lift of $x_i$ under the map $\cE(S) \to \cF(S)$. 
Let $y$ be the limit $y = \lim_{i \to \infty} [\varpi]_{\cE}^i(y_i)$ and put 
$$\qlog_\cF((x_1, x_2, \dots)) = \log_\cE(y) \in \Dio(\cF) \otimes_R(S \otimes_A K).$$ 

\begin{prop}
  This construction yields a well-defined map. 
\begin{proof}
  We may assume that $\cF$ and $\cV$ come from formal module laws $F$ and 
  $V$, and we may furthermore assume that $\cE = \FGG(E)$ 
  for an $\cO_K$-module law $E$ obtained by Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}. Now
  $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ is a sequence in $S^\cici$ and $(y_1, y_2, \dots)$ is a
  sequence of elements in $(S^\cici)^n$.

  It suffices to show that $y = \lim_{i\to \infty} [\varpi]^i_E(y_i)$ exists and 
  that it is independent of the choice of lifts $(y_1, y_2, \dots)$. 
  Both claims follow from the additivity of $\cV$, implying that 
  $[\varpi]_{V}(T) = \varpi T$. The sequence 
  $([\varpi^i]_{E}(y_i))$ converges, as for positive integers $i\leq j$, we have 
  \begin{equation*}
    [\varpi^i](y_i) - [\varpi^j](y_j) = [\varpi^i]([\varpi^{i-j}]y_j - y_i)
    \in \psi(\varpi^i (S^\cici)^{n-1}) \subseteq J^i (S^\cici)^{n}. 
  \end{equation*}

  If $(y_1', y'_2, \dots)$ is another sequence of lifts, put
  $y' = \lim_{i \to \infty} [\varpi^i]_E (y_i') \in S^\cici$. Now there exists some
  $z \in \cV(S)$ such that 
  $y - y' = \psi(z)$. But by construction
  $z \in \bigcap_{i \in \N} \varpi^i(S^{\cici})^{n-1} = 0$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

Let us now consider the case where $\cF = \FGG(H)$ comes from the standard
formal $\cO_K$-module of height $n$ over $\cO_{\breve K}$. Then 
from Proposition \ref{prop:InterestingSequenceStdMod} we have the distinguished
basis elements of $\Ext(H,\Ghat_a)$ corresponding to the symmetric $2$-cocycles
$\delta f_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ where $f_i(T) = \frac 1 \varpi
\log_H(T^{q^i})$. Also recall that, setting $f_0(T) = \log_H(T)$, the elements 
$(f_0, f_1, \dots, f_{n-1})$ freely generate $\QLog(H)$. The universal
additive extension now corresponds to the symmetric $2$-cocycle $(\delta f_1,
\dots, \delta f_{n-1}) \in \SymCoc^2(H,V)$.
We can make the quasi-logarithm map explicit.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:qlogmapExplicit}
  Let $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots) \in \Tilde H(S)$. With respect to the basis
  $(\log_H(T),\allowbreak \log_H(T^q), \allowbreak \dots, \allowbreak \log_H(T^{q^{n-1}}))$ of 
  $\QLog(H) \otimes_{\cO_K} K$, the quasi-logarithm map is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \qlog_H(x) = \left(\log_H(x_0), \log_H((\Pi x)_0), \dots, \log_H((\Pi^{n-1}
    x)_0)\right) \in (S\otimes K)^n.
  \end{equation*}
  Here, $\Pi x = ((\Pi x)_0, (\Pi x)_1, \dots)$ is the image of $x$ under
  $\Pi$, the automorphism of $\Tilde
  H(S)$ induced by the (relative) Frobenius quasi-isogeny on $H_0$, cf. Definition
  \ref{def:FrobOnUnivCov}.
\end{prop}
We postpone the proof to state the following auxiliary result.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:FrobOnTildeHExpl}
  Let $x = (x_0 ,x_1, \dots) \in \Tilde H(S)$. For positive integers $i$ and
  $j$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_H((\Pi^j x)_i) = \lim_{r \to \infty} \varpi^r \log_H(x_{r+i}^{q^j}).
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  Tracing through the commutative square (with $\lambda$ and $\mu$ the
  isomorphisms from the previous subsection)
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	{\Tilde H(S)} \& {\Nilp^\flat(S)} \\
    	{\Tilde H(S)} \& {\Nilp^\flat(S),}
    	\arrow["\lambda", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow["\Pi", from=1-1, to=2-1]
    	\arrow["{(y_i)_i \mapsto (y_i^{q})_i}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["\mu"', from=2-2, to=2-1]
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    we find 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:CompsOfPiExplicit}
      (\Pi^j x)_i = \lim_{s \to \infty} \lim_{r\to\infty} \left([\varpi]_H^s
      (x_{r+s+i}^{q^{nr + j}})\right).
    \end{equation}
    The claim follows after applying $\log_H$ and making repeated use of the
    functional equation $\log_H(T^{q^n}) = \varpi \log_H(T) + \varpi T$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:qlogmapExplicit}]
  Using the coordinates provided by $(\delta f_1, \dots, \delta f_{n-1})$, the
  universal additive extension of $H$ is isomorphic to 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \Ghat_a^{n-1} \to E \to H \to 0,
  \end{equation*}
  where $E$ is a module law with 
  \begin{equation*}
    [\varpi]_E(\bX, T) = \big(\varpi X_1 + (\delta_{\varpi}f_1)(T), \dots, \varpi X_{n-1} + 
    (\delta_{\varpi}f_{n-1})(T), [\varpi]_H(T)\big).
  \end{equation*}
  Beginning with $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots) \in \Tilde H (S)$, lifting to $(y_0,
  y_1, \dots) \in E(S)^\N$ 
  and writing $y = \lim_{i\to\infty} [\varpi]_E^i (y_i)$, we find
  \begin{equation*}
    y = \left(\lim_{r\to\infty} (\delta_{\varpi^r} f_1)(x_r), \dots, \lim_{r\to \infty}
    (\delta_{\varpi^r}f_{n-1})(x_r), x_0\right) \in E(S).
  \end{equation*}
  Now, Lemma \ref{lem:FrobOnTildeHExpl} provides the equality
  $$\lim_{r\to\infty}\delta_{\varpi^r} f_i(x_r) = \frac 1\varpi \lim_{r \to \infty}
  \varpi^r \log_H(x_r^{q^{nr+i}}) - \frac 1\varpi \log_H\left(x_0^{q^i}\right) = 
  \frac 1\varpi \left(\log_H((\Pi^i x)_0)- \log_H(x_0^{q^i})\right).$$
  We need to calculate $\log_E(y)$, which calls for an explicit description of 
  $\log_E \colon E \otimes (R \otimes_AK) \to (\Ghat_a \otimes(R \otimes_A K))^n$. 
  Tracing through the procedure provided in Subsection \ref{sub:Logarithms},
  we find
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_E(\bX, T) = \left(X_1 + \tfrac 1\varpi \log_H(T^q), \dots, 
    X_{n-1} + \tfrac 1\varpi \log_H(T^{q^{n-1}}), \log_H(T)\right).
  \end{equation*}
  This representation is with respect to the basis $(f_1, \dots, f_{n-1}, f_0)$. 
  The claim follows.
\end{proof}

\subsection{An Approximation of the Determinant Morphism} % (fold)
\label{sub:Determinants}
Let $H$ be the standard formal $\cO_K$-module over $\cO_{\breve K}$ of height
$n$. Write $\wedge H$ for the formal $\cO_K$-module over $\cO_{\breve K}$ with
logarithm
\begin{equation*}
  \log_{\wedge H}(T) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty (-1)^{(n-1)i} \frac{T^{qi}}{\varpi^i}.
\end{equation*}
By Hazewinkel's integrality Lemma (cf. Theorem \ref{thm:HazewinkelIntegrality}), 
such a module law exists. We have $\Dio(\wedge H) = \wedge^n \Dio(H)$. 
We follow \cite[Theorem 2.10.3]{BoyarchenkoWeinstein2011MaxVar} to describe a map $\delta:
\Tilde H^n \to \Tilde {\wedge H}$ making the square

\end{equation}
commute. 

Let $(s_1, \dots, s_n) \in \Tilde H(S)^n$, and write $x_i = \lambda(s_i) \in
\Nilp^\flat(S)$, which are elements in $S^\cici$ with distinguished $q$-power
roots. Here $\lambda: \Tilde H \to \Nilp^\flat$ is the isomorphism from Section
\ref{sub:Tate Modules and the Universal Cover} with inverse $\mu = (\mu_0,
\mu_1, \dots)$. 
We set
\begin{equation*}
  \delta_0(s_1, \dots, s_n) = \sum_{(a_1, \dots, a_n)} \varepsilon(a_1, \dots
  a_n) \mu_0(x_1^{q^{a_1}} \cdots x_n^{q^{a_n}}) \in \wedge H(S),
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The sum takes place in ${\wedge H}(S)$.
  \item The sum ranges over $n$-tuples $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ of (possibly negative) integers 
    satisfying $a_1 + \dots + a_n = n (n-1)/2$, subject to the
    condition that each $a_i$ occupies a distinct residue class modulo $n$.
  \item The expression $\varepsilon(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ denotes the sign of the 
    permutation $i \mapsto a_{i+1}$ (mod $n$) of $(0, \dots, n-1)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:commutativityofdeterminantqlogdiag}
  The map $\delta_0$ makes the diagram

    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commute. It is $\cO_K$-multilinear and alternating.
\begin{proof}
  This is part of the proof of \cite[Theorem
  2.10.3]{BoyarchenkoWeinstein2011MaxVar}.
  Commutativity follows from 
  \begin{multline*}
    \log_{\wedge H}(\delta_0(s_1, \dots, s_n)) = \sum_{(a_1, \dots, a_n)} 
    \varepsilon(\mathbf a) \log_{\wedge H} \mu_0( x_1^{q^{a_1}}\cdots x_n^{q^{a_n}})
     \\ = \sum_{(a_1, \dots, a_n)} \varepsilon(\mathbf a) \sum_{m \in \Z} (-1)^{(n-1)m}
    \frac{x_1^{q^{a_1+m}} \cdots x_n^{q^{a_n+m}}}{\varpi^m} 
    = \det \left( \sum_{m \in \Z} \frac{x_i^{q^{mn + j-1}}}{\varpi^m} \right)_{\substack{
      1 \leq i \leq n,\\
      1 \leq j \leq n}},
  \end{multline*}
  which is equal to $\det(\qlog_H^n(s_1, \dots, s_n))$ by Proposition 
  \ref{prop:qlogmapExplicit} and Lemma \ref{lem:LogInTermsOfNil}. 
  The fact that $\delta_0$ is multilinear and alternating ultimately follows
  from the corresponding properties of $\det$, the fact that $\ker(\log_H) =
  \wedge H[\varpi^\infty]$ (cf. Lemma \ref{lem:KernelOfLog}) and topological
  considerations in the induced diagram in the category of adic spaces over
  $(\breve K, \cO_{\breve K})$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

This allows us to define the sought for morphism of functors
$\delta: \Tilde H^n \to \Tilde {\wedge H}$. 
\begin{defi}\label{def:DeltaMap}
  Put $\delta_i(s_1, \dots, s_n) = \delta_0(\varpi^{-i} s_1, \dots, s_n)$. Then 
  $\delta = (\delta_0, \delta_1, \dots)$ yields a map 
  $\Tilde H^n \to \Tilde{\wedge H}$. It is $K$-multilinear and alternating.
\end{defi}

Using the canonical identifications $\Tilde {H}^n \cong (\Nilp^\flat)^n$
and $\Tilde{\wedge H} \cong \Nilp^\flat$, the morphism $\delta$ yields a 
map $(\Nilp^\flat)^n \to \Nilp^\flat$, which in turn is the same as a power series 
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta(X_1, \dots, X_n) \in \cO_{\breve K}\llbr X_1^{q^{-\infty}}, \dots,
  X_n^{q^{-\infty}}\rrbr
\end{equation*}
together with distinguished $q$-th power roots. 
We have the following approximation of $\Delta$, cf. \cite[Lemma 2.10.4]{BoyarchenkoWeinstein2011MaxVar}. 
\begin{lem}\label{lem:DeltaApprox}
  We have 
  \begin{equation*}
    \Delta(X_1, \dots, X_n) \equiv \det(X_i^{q^{j-1}})_{\substack{1 \leq
  i \leq n,\\ 1 \leq j \leq n}} 
  \end{equation*}
  modulo terms of degree greater than $1 + q + \dots + q^{n-1}$.
\begin{proof}
  By Proposition \ref{prop:commutativityofdeterminantqlogdiag} and 
  the explicit description of the quasi-logarithm map in Proposition
  \ref{prop:qlogmapExplicit}, we have the equality
  \begin{equation*}
    \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty (-1)^{(n-1) k} \frac{\Delta(X_1, \dots,
    X_n)^{q^k}}{\varpi^k} = 
    \det \left( \sum_{k = -\infty}^\infty

  \end{equation*}
  of elements inside $\br E \llbr X_1^{q^{-\infty}}, \dots, X_n^{q^{-\infty}} \rrbr$
  (equipped with the topology induced from the 
  $(\varpi, X_1, \allowbreak \dots, X_n)$-adic topology on $\cO_\br E\llbr
  X_1^{q^{-\infty}}, \dots, X_n^{q^{-\infty}} \rrbr$).
  The claim follows after comparing coefficients of the respective series.
