\section{Formal Modules}
This section will serve as an introduction to formal groups and 
formal modules. Formal groups (or rather, formal group laws) were first
introduced by \textsc{Salomon Bochner} in 1946 as a natural means of studying Lie
Groups over fields of characteristic $0$, cf. \cite{Bochner1946FGrps}. 
The study of formal groups later became interesting for its own right, 
with pioneering works of Lazard \cite{Lazard1955FGrps}. \todo{blabla}

 \label{sub:Exact Categories Extensions of Formal Modules}

In this section, we equip the category $\FMArbOver AX$, where 
$A$ is any ring and $X$ is a quasi-compact and quasi-separated $A$-scheme,
with a notion of short exact sequences. We show that this gives $\FMArbOver AX$ 
the structure of an exact category in the sense of 
Quillen \cite[Appendix A]{keller1990chain}. We introduce functors
\begin{align*}
  \Ext(-,-)&: \FMArbOver AX^\opp \times \FMArbOver AX \to \Set \\
  \RigExt(-,-)&: \FMArbOver AX^\opp \times \FMArbOver AX \to \Set,
\end{align*}
which send a pair $(\cF, \cF')$ to the set of equialence classses of 
extensions (resp. rigidified extensions) of $\cF$ by $\cF'$. These functors
will play a major role in the upcoming discussion.

\subsubsection{The Category of Formal Modules is Exact} % (fold)
\label{ssub:The Category of Formal Modules is Exact}
Before turning our attention to formal modules, we introduce the notion of 
exact categories, following \cite[Appendix A]{keller1990chain}.

\begin{defi}[Exact Category]
  Let $\cA$ be an additive category, and let $\cE$ be a class whose
  members are exact triples of objects connected by arrows 
  \begin{equation*}
    X \xto i Y \xto d Z,
  \end{equation*}
  where $i$ is a kernel of $d$ and $d$ is a cokernel of $i$. 
  We call a morphism $i:X \to Y$ an inflation if it apears as first component
  of some $(i,d) \in E$, second components are called deflations.
  We say that the pair $(\cA, \cE)$ is an exact category if 
  $\cE$ is closed under isomorphisms and satisfies the following properties.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The identity $\id_0: 0 \to 0$ is a deflation.
    \item The composition of two deflations is a deflation.
    \item For each $f \in \Hom_\cA(Z', Z)$, there is a cartesian square
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
        	{Y'} \& {Z'} \\
        	Y \& Z
        	\arrow["{d'}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
        	\arrow["{f'}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
        	\arrow["f", from=1-2, to=2-2]
        	\arrow["d"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    such that $d'$ is a deflation.
  \item[3\textsuperscript{op}.] For each $f \in \Hom_\cA(X, X')$, there is a
    co-cartesian square
      \begin{equation*}
        \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
        	X \& Y \\
        	{X'} \& {Y'}
        	\arrow["i", from=1-1, to=1-2]
        	\arrow["f"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
        	\arrow["{f'}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
        	\arrow["{i'}"', from=2-1, to=2-2]
        \end{tikzcd}
      \end{equation*}
      such that $i'$ is an inflation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defi}

As above, suppose that $A$ is any ring and $X$ is a quasi-compact and
quasi-separated $A$-scheme. Let $\cF$, $\cE$ and $\cF'$ be formal $A$-modules
over $X$. As a primer, we note that the category $\FMArbOver AX$ is additive 
(essentially by Lemma \ref{lem:FGLAdditive}).

\begin{defi}[Short Exact Sequence]\label{def:SESofFormalModules}
  A pair of composable morphisms $\cF' \to \cE \to \cF$ in 
  $\FMArbOver A X$ is called 
  a short exact sequence if the induced sequence 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \Lie(\cF') \to \Lie(\cE) \to \Lie(\cF) \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  is a short exact sequence of $\cO_X$-modules. In this case, we write
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cF' \to \cE \to \cF' \to 0.
  \end{equation*}
  A pair of composable morphisms $F' \to E \to F$ in $\FMLArbOver AR$
  is called an exact sequence if it is exact after passing to 
  the respective formal modules. 
\end{defi}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:SESStandardForm}
  \todo{CONDITIONS ON R; NEED FORMAL IMPLICIT FUNCTION THEROEM!}
  Let $R$ be an $A$-algebra and let $F, F' \in \FMLArbOver AR$ be 
  formal $A$-module laws of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively. Write 
  $\cF', \cF \in \FMArbOver AR$ for the associated formal $A$-modules,
  and suppose that they fit into a exact sequence
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cF' \xto \alpha \cE \xto \beta \cF \to 0.
  \end{equation*}
  Write $\bX$ for the variables of $F'$ and $\bZ$ for those of $F$. Then 
  there exists a (non-canonical) coordinate on $\cE$ giving rise to a formal
  $A$-module law $E$ in the variables $(\bX, \bZ)$ such that the induced morphisms
  of formal module laws are of the form 
  $\alpha(\bX) = (\bX, 0)$, $\beta(\bX, \bZ) = \bZ$. Furthermore, 
  the formal $A$-module law $E$ is of the form
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:SESStandardFormModuleLaw}
  \begin{gathered}
    E((\bX_1, \bZ_1), (\bX_2, \bZ_2)) = (F'(\bX_1, \bX_2) +_{F'} \Delta(\bZ_1,
    \bZ_2) , F(\bZ_1, \bZ_2)) \\
    \text{and} \\
    [a]_E(\bX, \bZ) = ([a]_{F'}(\bX) +_{F'} \delta_a(\bZ), [a]_F(\bZ)).
  \end{gathered}
  \end{equation}
  for some $m$-tuple of power series $\Delta \in (R\llbr \bZ_1, \bZ_2 \rrbr)^m$,
  $\delta_a \in (R\llbr \bZ \rrbr)^m$. 
\begin{proof}
  The construction of $E$ is sketched in \cite[Proposition
  6.5]{hopkins1994equivariant}. We know that $\cE \cong \spf R\llbr M \rrbr$ 
  for some free $R$ module $M$ of rank $m+n$. As we have a short 
  exact sequence on Lie-algebras, we may apply the formal implicit function
  theorem \todo{reference/proof} to obtain a section 
  $\sigma: \cF \to \cE$ of $\beta:\cE \to \cF$. 
  The datum of the morphisms $\alpha$ and $\sigma$ is equivalent to 
  morphisms
  \begin{equation*}
    \alpha^\flat: R \llbr M \rrbr \to R \llbr \bX \rrbr \quad \text{and} \quad
    \sigma^\flat: R \llbr M \rrbr \to R \llbr \bZ \rrbr
  \end{equation*}
  on affines. Taking their sum, we obtain a morphism $R \llbr M \rrbr
  \to R\llbr \bX, \bT \rrbr$. On Lie-algebras, this morphism recovers the
  isomorphism $\Lie(\cE) \cong \Lie(\cF') \oplus \Lie(\cF)$ induced by 
  $\Lie(\sigma)$. In particular, $\sigma^\flat + \alpha^\flat$ is an isomorphism
  in degree $1$, hence an isomorphism. This yields the desired
  coordinate $\cE \cong \spf R\llbr \bX, \bZ\rrbr$. The fact about the 
  structure of the formal $A$-module law $E$ follows quickly from the fact that 
  $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are morphisms of formal $A$-module laws. 
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
Let's turn our attention to the power series $(\Delta, (\delta_a)_{a\in A})$
appearing in the above Lemma. They satisfy certain conditions.
\begin{defi}[Symmetric 2-cocycles]\label{def:SymCoc2}
  Let $\SymCoc^2(F, F')$ be the set of collections of power series $(\Delta,
  (\delta_a)_{a \in A})$ satisfying the following properties
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta(\bZ_1,\bZ_2) = \Delta(\bZ_2,\bZ_1)$
    \item $\Delta(\bZ_2,\bZ_3) +_{F'} \Delta(\bZ_1, F(\bZ_2,\bZ_3)) = \Delta(F(\bZ_1,\bZ_2), \bZ_3) +_{F'} \Delta(\bZ_1,\bZ_2)$
    \item $\delta_a(\bZ_1) +_{F'} \delta_a(\bZ_2) +_{F'} \Delta([a]_F(\bZ_1), [a]_F(\bZ_2)) = 
      [a]_{F'}\Delta(\bZ_1,\bZ_2) +_{F'} \delta_a(F(\bZ_1,\bZ_2))$
    \item $\delta_a(\bZ_1) +_{F'} \delta_b(\bZ_1) +_{F'} \Delta([a]_F(\bZ_1), [b]_F(\bZ_1)) =
      \delta_{a+b}(\bZ_1)$
    \item $[a]_{F'}\delta_b(\bZ_1) +_{F'} \delta_a([b]_F(\bZ_1)) = \delta_{ab}(\bZ_1)$.
  \end{itemize}
  These objects are called symmetric $2$-cocycles. The set $\SymCoc^2(F, F')$
  is naturally a left-$\End(F')$-module.
\end{defi}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:ClassOfFGLitoSymCoc}
  There is a bijection 
  \begin{equation*}
    \SymCoc^2(F, F') \xto \sim \left\{
      \begin{gathered}
        \text{$A$-module laws $E$ on $R\llbr \bX, \bZ \rrbr$ fitting into an
        exact sequence}
        \\ 0 \to F' \xto \alpha E \xto \beta F \to 0 \\
        \text{where $\alpha(\bX) = (\bX, 0)$ and $\beta(\bX, \bZ) = \bZ$. }
      \end{gathered}
      \right\}
  \end{equation*}
  The map sends a pair $\{\Delta, (\delta_a)_a\}$ to the $A$-module law with
  structure defined following \eqref{eq:SESStandardFormModuleLaw}. 
  \begin{proof}[Proof]
    This is only a matter of calculation, cf. \cite[Section
    6]{hopkins1994equivariant}.
  \end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}
  If $\cF'$, $\cE$ and $\cF$ are formal $A$-modules over a qcqs $A$-scheme $X$,
  and $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are morphisms such that 
  $0 \to \cF' \xto\alpha \cE \xto\beta \cF \to 0$ 
  is a short exact sequence of formal $A$-modules, $\alpha$ is a kernel of
  $\beta$ and $\beta$ is a cokernel of $\alpha$. 
\begin{proof}
  Let $\psi: \cG \to \cE$ be a morphism of formal $A$-modules such that
  the composition $\cG \xto\psi \cE \xto\beta \cF$ is trivial. 
  We have to show that there is a unique morphism $\bar \psi: \cG \to 
  \cF'$ making the following diagram commute.
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	0 \& {\cF'} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0 \\
    	\&\& \cG
    	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow["\alpha", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    	\arrow["\beta", from=1-3, to=1-4]
    	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    	\arrow["{\exists!\overline \psi}", dashed, from=2-3, to=1-2]
    	\arrow["{\psi}"', from=2-3, to=1-3]
    	\arrow["0"', from=2-3, to=1-4]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  As $\overline \psi$ is unique, we may work locally $X$ and assume that $X =
  \spec R$ is affine and 
  $\cF'$, $\cF$ and $\cG$ all come from formal $A$-module laws. We may
  now assume that the short exact sequence is in the form of Lemma
  \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}. Write $E$, $F$, $F'$, $G$ for the 
  formal $A$-module laws corresponding to $\cE$, $\cF$, $\cF'$ and 
  $\cG$. Write $\bY$ for the variables of $G$. Now, as 
  $\beta \circ \psi = 0$, the induced morphism of
  formal $A$-module laws $\psi: G \to E$ is of the form $\psi(\bY) =
  (\psi_1(\bY), 0)$, and we find that $\psi_1(\bY) \in (R\llbr \bY \rrbr)^m$
  yields a morphism of formal $A$-modules $G \to F'$. It is clearly unique. 
  
  Similar ideas show that $\beta$ is a cokernel of $\alpha$. 
\end{proof}

\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
  The composition of two deflations of formal $A$-modules is a deflation.
\begin{proof}
  \red{Proof is simple application of Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm} but no
  time to write down} 
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
  Let $0 \to \cF' \xto\alpha \cE \xto\beta \cF \to 0$ be a short exact sequence in 
  $\FMLArbOver AX$. If $f \in \Hom_{\FMArbOver AX} \cG \to \cF$ is a morphism 
  of formal $A$-modules, then there is a formal $A$-module $f^*\cE$ 
  and a deflation $f^*\cE \to \cG$ fitting into a diagram with short exact 
  sequences as rows
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	    0 \& {\cF'} \& {f^*\cE} \& \cG \& 0 \\
	    0 \& {\cF'} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0
	    \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	    \arrow["{\alpha'}", from=1-2, to=1-3]
	    \arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-2, to=2-2]
	    \arrow["{\beta'}", from=1-3, to=1-4]
	    \arrow[from=1-3, to=2-3]
	    \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
	    \arrow["f", from=1-4, to=2-4]
	    \arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	    \arrow["\alpha", from=2-2, to=2-3]
	    \arrow["\beta", from=2-3, to=2-4]
	    \arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  The square on the right is cartesian.
\begin{proof}
  Assume first that $X = \spec R$ is affine and that $\cF$, $\cF'$ and $\cG$ 
  come from formal $A$-module laws over $R$. Then we assume to be in the
  situation of Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}, with
  $\cE$ coming from a formal $A$-module law $E$. Using the induced morphism 
  $f: G \to F$ of formal $A$-module laws, define the $A$-module law
  law $f^* E$ via
  \begin{gather*}
    f^*E((\bX_1, \bY_1), (\bX_2, \bY_2)) = (F'(\bX_1, \bX_2) +_{F'}
    \Delta(f(\bY_1), f(\bY_2)) , G(\bY_1, \bY_2)) \\
    \text{and } \\
    [a]_{f^*E}(\bX, \bY) = ([a]_{F'}(\bX) +_{F'} \delta_a(f(\bY)), [a]_F(\bY)).
  \end{gather*}
  Here, $\Delta$ and $\delta_a$ are the power series coming from $E$ (cf.
  Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}).
  Now the top-row is exact with $\alpha'(\bX) = (\bX, 0)$ and 
  $\beta'(\bX, \bY) = \bY$. 
  The morphism of $A$-module laws $f^*E \to E$ is given by 
  $(\bX, \bY)\mapsto (\bX,f(\bY))$. One readily checks that 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	{f^*E} \& G \\
    	E \& F
    	\arrow["{\beta'}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
    	\arrow["f", from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["\beta", from=2-1, to=2-2]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  is cartesian in the category of formal $A$-module laws over $R$. 
  As the data of $\cE$ glue, the power series defining $f^*E$ glue to give
  a formal $A$-module $f^*\cE$, satisfying all of the desired properties.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

The dual statement is also true. 
\begin{lem}
  Let $0 \to \cF' \xto \alpha \cE \xto\beta \cF \to 0$ be as above, and let
  $g \in \Hom_{\FMArbOver AX}(\cF', \cG')$ be a morphism of formal 
  $A$ modules. There is a formal $A$-module $g_*\cE$ over $X$ and an
  inflation $\alpha':\cG' \to g_*\cE$ fitting into a diagram with short 
  exact sequences
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	0 \& {\cF'} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0 \\
    	0 \& {\cG'} \& {g_* \cE} \& \cF \& 0
    	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow["\alpha", from=1-2, to=1-3]
    	\arrow["g"', from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["\beta", from=1-3, to=1-4]
    	\arrow[from=1-3, to=2-3]
    	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-4, to=2-4]
    	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["{\alpha'}", from=2-2, to=2-3]
    	\arrow["{\beta'}", from=2-3, to=2-4]
    	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  We proceed as in the proof of the previous lemma and assume that 
  $X = \spec R$ and that $\cF'$, $\cF$ and $\cG$ come from formal $A$-module
  laws over $R$. Now $E$ is a formal $A$-module law over $R$ of the form 
  described in Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}, and 
  using the power series $\Delta$ and $\delta_a$ we define $g_* E$ via 
  \begin{gather*}
    g_*E((\bY_1, \bZ_1), (\bY_2, \bZ_2)) = (G'(\bY_1, \bY_2) +_{G'}
    g(\Delta(\bZ_1, \bZ_2)) , F(\bZ_1, \bZ_2)) \\
    \text{and } \\
    [a]_{g_*E}(\bX, \bY) = ([a]_{G'}(\bX) +_{G'} g(\delta_a(\bZ)), [a]_F(\bZ)).
  \end{gather*}
  The morphism $E \to g_*E$ is given by $(\bX, \bZ) \mapsto (g(\bX), \bZ)$. 
  These data glue and give rise to a formal $A$-module
  $g_*\cE$ over $X$ satisfying the desired properties.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

As a consequence of the previous lemmas, we obtain
\begin{prop}\label{prop:FMArbIsExact}
  Let $S$ be a quasi-compact and quasi-separated $S$-scheme. Then
  the category $\FMLArbOver AS$, equipped with the notion of exact sequences
  from Definition \ref{def:SESofFormalModules}, is an exact category. 
\end{prop}

The following calculation is convenient.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:LieAlgebrasOfPBandPFW}
  We have natural isomorpisms 
  \begin{equation*}
    \Lie(f^* \cE) \cong \Lie(\cE) \times_{\Lie(\cF)} \Lie(\cG) \quad \text{and}
    \quad \Lie(g_* \cE) \cong \Lie(\cG') \sqcup_{\Lie(\cF')} \Lie(\cE).
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  This is true locally, and the local descriptions descent to $X$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\subsubsection{Extensions and Rigidified Extensions} % (fold)
\label{ssub:Extensions and Rigidified Extensions}
We now introduce the functors $\Ext$ and $\RigExt$. 
Let $\cF$ and $\cF'$ be formal $A$-modules over an $A$-scheme $S$.
\begin{defi}[Extension]
  An extension of $\cF$ by $\cF'$ is a short exact sequence 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cF' \to \cE \to \cF \to 0.
  \end{equation*}
  We say that this extension is equivalent to another extension 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cF' \to \cE' \to \cF \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  if and only if there is an isomorphism $\cE \to \cE'$ making the diagram 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	0 \& {\cF'} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0 \\
    	0 \& {\cF'} \& {\cE'} \& \cF \& 0
    	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
    	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
    	\arrow[from=1-3, to=2-3]
    	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-4, to=2-4]
    	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
    	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
    	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
    	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commute. We denote the set of equivalence classes of extensions of $\cF$ by
  $\cF'$ as $\Ext(\cF, \cF')$. 
\end{defi}
Proposition \ref{prop:FMArbIsExact} turns $\Ext(-,-)$ into a functor.
In particular, $\Ext(\cF,\cF')$ carries the structure of a
left-$\End(\cF')$-module,
with zero-object given by the canonical extension $\cF \oplus \cF'$.

\begin{defi}[Rigifidied Extension]
  A rigidified extension of $\cF$ by $\cF'$ is a pair consisting of an extension
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cF' \to \cE \to \cF \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  and a splitting $s$ of the short exact sequence
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
      0 \& {\Lie(\cF')} \& {\Lie(\cE)} \& {\Lie(\cF)} \& 0.
  	  \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
  	  \arrow["", from=1-2, to=1-3]
  	  \arrow["", from=1-3, to=1-4]
  	  \arrow["s", curve={height=-12pt}, from=1-4, to=1-3]
  	  \arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  We say that two rigidified extensions $(E,s)$, $(E',s')$ are isomorphic if there 
  is an isomorphism $i: E \to E'$ of extensions such that $s' = \Lie(i) \circ s$. 
  We denote the set of isomorphism classes of rigidified extensions by 
  $\RigExt(\cF, \cF')$. 
\end{defi}
\begin{lem}
  The assignment $(\cF, \cF') \mapsto \RigExt(\cF,\cF')$ extends to 
  a functor in both entries (contravariant in the first, covariant in the
  second). 
\begin{proof}
  Given a morphism 
  $f: \cG \to \cF$, the induced morphism $\RigExt(\cF, \cF') \to 
  \RigExt(\cG, \cF')$ is given by sending the pair $(\cE,s)$ to
  the pair $(f^*\cE, s')$, where 
  \begin{equation*}
    s': \Lie(\cG) \to \Lie(f^*\cE) \cong \Lie(\cE) \times_{\Lie(\cF)} \Lie(\cG),
    \quad x \mapsto ((s \circ \Lie(f)) (x), x). 
  \end{equation*}
  Here we used the description of $\Lie(f^*\cE)$ from Lemma
  \ref{lem:LieAlgebrasOfPBandPFW}.
  Similarly, given a morphism $g: \cF' \to \cG'$, the induced morphism 
  $\RigExt(\cF, \cF') \to \RigExt(\cF, \cG')$ sends $(\cE,s)$ to
  $(g_*\cE, \Lie(g') \circ s)$, where $g': \cE \to g_* \cE$ is the 
  canonical morphism.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
In particular, $\RigExt(-,\cF')$ carries the structure of an 
$\End(\cF')$-module, the zero-object is given by the equivalence class of 
the pair
$(\cF' \oplus \cF, s_{\mathrm{triv}})$, where 
$s_{\mathrm{triv}}: \Lie(\cF) \to \Lie(\cF') \oplus \Lie(\cF)$ is the canonical
inclusion.

Of course there is a natural transformation $\RigExt(-,-) \to \Ext(-,-)$,
forgetting the splitting. It appears as the right-most
term of an interesting exact sequence.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:InterestingES}
  There is an exact sequence of Abelian groups, functorial in
  $\cF$ and $\cF'$
  \begin{equation*}
    \Hom_{\FMArbOver AS}(\cF, \cF') \xto{\Lie} \Hom_{\QCoh {\cO_S}}(\Lie(\cF), \Lie(\cF'))
    \to \RigExt(\cF, \cF') \to \Ext(\cF, \cF'). 
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  The kernel of $\RigExt(\cF,\cF') \to \Ext(\cF,\cF')$ is given (up to
  equivalence) by 
  pairs of the form $(\cF' \oplus \cF, s)$, where $s$ is a morphism
  of quasi-coherent $\cO_S$-modules such that 
  $$ \Lie(\cF) \xto s \Lie(\cF') \oplus \Lie(\cF) \to  \Lie(\cF)$$
  is the identity. It is clear that these morphisms $s$ correspond to morphisms 
  $\Lie(\cF) \to \Lie(\cF')$. 

  The kernel of $\Hom_{\QCoh {\cO_S}}(\Lie(\cF), \Lie(\cF')) \to \RigExt(\cF,
  \cF')$ is spanned by those pairs $(\cE,s)$ that are in the same 
  class as $(\cF' \oplus \cF, s_{\mathrm{triv}})$. Any such $\cE$ fits into
  a diagram 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	0 \& {\cF'} \& {\cF' \oplus \cF} \& \cF \& 0 \\
    	0 \& {\cF'} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0.
    	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
    	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
    	\arrow["\psi", from=1-3, to=2-3]
    	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
    	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-4, to=2-4]
    	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["\alpha", from=2-2, to=2-3]
    	\arrow["\beta", from=2-3, to=2-4]
    	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  Working locally, we assume that $\cE$, $\cF$ and $\cF'$ come from formal 
  module laws $E$, $F$ and $F'$. Now $\psi$ is necessarily of the form
  $\psi(\bX, \bZ) = (\bX +_{F'} g(\bZ), \bZ)$. Hence, the power series
  $g$ furnishes a morphism of formal module laws $F \to F'$. This construction
  descents to a morphism of formal $A$-modules $\cF \to \cF'$, and we have 
  $$s(x) = \Lie(\psi) \circ s_{\mathrm{triv}}(x) = \Lie(\alpha)\circ\Lie(g)(x)
  + x \in \Lie(\cE).$$
  This explains exactness on the left.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Explicit Dieudonné Theory} % (fold)
\label{ssub:Explicit Dieudonne Theory}
Let $\cF$ and $\cF'$ be formal $A$-modules of dimension $m$ and $n$ respectively,
over an affine base $\spec R$, coming from formal module laws $F$ and $F'$. We
give an explicit description of $\Ext(\cF, \cF')$ in terms of terms of the
Symmetric 2-Cocycles associated with $F$ and $F'$ (cf. Definition
\ref{def:SymCoc2}). 
We also give a related explicit description of $\RigExt(F, \GG_a)$ in terms of 
Quasi-Logarithms, cf. Definition \ref{def:QuasiLogarithm}. 

Write $\bX$ for the variables of $F'$ and $\bZ$ for the variables of $F$.
\begin{defi}[Symmetric $1$-Cochain] \label{def:SymCoc1}
  A symmetric $1$-cochain associated to $(F,F')$ is a $n$-tuple of power 
  series $\bgg = (g_1, \dots, g_m)$, such that $g_i(\bZ) \in R\llbr \bZ \rrbr$
  has no constant term for all $i$. We write $\delta \bgg$ 
  for the coboundary of $\bgg$, that is, the pair $(\Delta \bgg, (\delta_a
  \bgg)_{a \in A})$,
  where
  \begin{equation*}
    \Delta \bgg = \bgg(\bZ_1) -_{F'} \bgg(F(\bZ_1,\bZ_2)) +_{F'} \bgg(\bZ_2)
    \in (R\llbr \bZ_1, \bZ_2 \rrbr)^m
  \end{equation*}
  and 
  \begin{equation*}
    \delta_a \bgg = [a]_{F'} \bgg(\bZ) -_{F'} \bgg([a]_F(\bZ)) \in (R \llbr \bZ
    \rrbr)^m.
  \end{equation*}
  One readily checks that $\delta \bgg \in \SymCoc^2(F, F')$. 
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc}
  Given two extensions $\cE,\cE' \in \Ext(\cF, \cF')$, write 
  $E$, $E'$ for the respective formal $A$-module laws coming from Lemma
  $\ref{lem:SESStandardForm}$, and write
  $\Delta_E$ and $\Delta_{E'}$ for the associated symmetric $2$-cocycles (cf.
  Proposition \ref{prop:ClassOfFGLitoSymCoc}). There is a bijection
  \begin{equation*}
    \{\bgg \in (R\llbr \bZ \rrbr)^m \mid \bgg(0) = 0 \text{ and } \delta \bgg = \Delta_{E'} - \Delta_E\}
    \xto \sim \{\text{Isomorphisms of extensions } E \to E' \}.
  \end{equation*}
  Explicitly, this bijection is given by sending $\bgg$ to the morphism
  $i_\bgg \in \Hom_{\FMLArbOver A R}(E, E')$, where 
  $i_\bgg (\bX, \bZ) = (\bX +_{F'} \bgg(\bZ), \bZ)$. In particular, there is a bijection
  \begin{equation*}
    \Ext(\cF, \cF') \cong \frac{\SymCoc^2(F, F')}{\{\delta \bgg 
    \mid \bgg \in (R\llbr \bZ \rrbr)^m \text{ with } \bgg(0) = 0\}}.
  \end{equation*}
  This bijection is an isomorphism of $\End(\cF')$-modules.
\end{prop}
For now, this finishes the study of $\Ext(\cF, \cF')$. 

Assume now that $\cF' = \GG_a$, and that 
$\cF$ comes from a one-dimensional formal $A$-module $F \in \FMLOver AR$. For
the remainder of this subsection, we will be concerned with the $R$-module
$\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a)$. The notion of Quasi-Logarithms will play a major role.

\begin{defi}[Quasi-Logarithms]\label{def:QuasiLogarithm}
  A power series $g(T) \in (R \otimes_A K) \llbr T \rrbr$ is called a 
  Quasi-Logarithm for $F$, if $g(0) = 0$ and $g'(T)$, as well as all 
  of the power series appearing in $\delta g$ (with $F' = \GG_a$, cf.
  Definition \ref{def:SymCoc1})
  have coefficients in $R$. We define the $R$-module
  \begin{equation*}
    \QLog(F) = \frac{\{g(T) \in (R \otimes_A K) \llbr T \rrbr \mid g \text{ is a 
    quasi-logarithm for } F\}}{\{g(T) \in R\llbr T \rrbr \mid g(0) = 0\}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{defi}

Let $(\cE,s) \in \RigExt(F,\GG_a)$ be a rigidified extension. 
The splitting $s$ yields an isomorphism $\omega(\cE) \cong \omega(\GG_a) \oplus
\omega(\cF)$ on duals, giving an invariant differential $\omega_\cE \in
\omega(\cE)$ pulling back to $\dc X$ on $\GG_a$. Conversely, any such invariant
differential $\omega_\cE$ yields a splitting, so the choice of $s$ is
equivalent to the choice of $\omega_E$, and we will henceforth write 
$(\cE, \omega_\cE) \in \RigExt(\cF, \GG_a)$. 

\begin{thm}[Classification of Rigidified Extensions in terms of Quasi-Logarithms]
  \label{thm:RigExtStr}
  There is a bijection
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:QLogBijection}
    \{\text{Quasi-logarithms for $F$}\} \xto \sim 
      \left\{
      \begin{gathered}
        \text{Pairs $(E, \omega_E)$, where $E$ is an $A$-module law} \\
        \text{fitting into  an exact sequence}
        \\ 0 \to \GG_a \xto \alpha E \xto \beta F \to 0 \\
        \text{with $\alpha(X) = (X, 0)$ and $\beta(X, T) = T$ and $\omega_E$} \\
        \text{is an invariant differential on $E$ with 
        $\alpha^* \omega_E = \dc X$.} \\
      \end{gathered}
      \right\}
  \end{equation}
The map sends any quasi-logarithm $g(T) \in (R\otimes_A K)\llbr T \rrbr$
to the pair $(E_{\delta g}, \dc (X + g(T)) \in \RigExt(F, \GG_a)$. Here
$E_{\delta g} \in \Ext(F, \GG_a)$ is the extension corresponding to 
$\delta g \in \SymCoc^2(F,\GG_a)$. 

Furthermore, given two rigidified extensions
$(E, \omega_E), (D, \omega_{D})$ with associated quasi-logarithms
$g(T)$ and $h(T)$, there is a (uniqe) isomorphism $(E, \omega_E) \to (D \omega_{D})$
if and only if $h(T)-g(T) =: f(T)$ has coefficients in $R\llbr T \rrbr$. 
In this case, the isomorphism $i_f(X,T) \in \Hom_{\FMLArbOver A R}(E, D)$ is
given by $i_f(X,T) = (X+f(T), T)$. In particular, there is a canonical bijection
\begin{equation*}
  \QLog(F) \xto \sim \RigExt(F, \GG_a).
\end{equation*}
This bijection is an isomorphism of $R$-modules.
\begin{proof}[Proof]
  We construct an inverse of the map in \eqref{eq:QLogBijection}. Let $(E,
  \omega_E)$ be an element of the set on the right
  and let $(\Delta, (\delta_a)_{a \in A}) \in
  \SymCoc^2(F, \GG_a)$ be the symmetric 2-cochain corresponding to $E$.
  Following Proposition \ref{prop:loginvdiff}, the datum of 
  $\omega_E \in \omega(E)$ is equivalent to a morphism 
  $$f_E \in \Hom_{\FMLOver A {R \otimes K}}(E \otimes_R (R \otimes_A K), \GG_a)
  \quad \text{satisfying} \quad f_E(X,T) = X + g(T)$$
  for some $g(T) \in (R \otimes_A K)\llbr T \rrbr$. The fact that 
  $f_E$ is a homomorphism implies that 
  \begin{multline*}
    X_1 + X_2 + \Delta(T_1, T_2) + g(F(T_1,T_2)) = f_E(E((X_1, T_1), (X_2, T_2))) = \\
    = f_E(X_1, T_1) + f_E(X_2, T_2)) = X_1 + g(T_1) + X_2 + g(T_2),
  \end{multline*}
  thereby $\Delta g = \Delta(T_1, T_2) \in R\llbr T_1, T_2\rrbr$. Similarly, 
  we find $\delta_a g = \delta_a \in R\llbr T \rrbr$. Hence, $g(T)$ is a
  quasi-logarithm with $\delta g = (\Delta, (\delta_a)_a)$. 
  This construction yields the desired inverse.
  The remaining statements are verified directly, also cf. \cite[Section
  8]{hopkins1994equivariant}.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

Now, let $A$ be a complete, discrete valuation ring with 
uniformizing parameter $\varpi$ and finite residue field $k$. 
\begin{prop} \label{prop:ExplicitInterestingES}
  If $\cF$ comes from a one-dimensional formal $A$-module law over a flat, local
  $A$-algebra $R$ and $\cF' = \GG_a$,
  the short exact sequence of Proposition \ref{prop:InterestingES}
  fits into a commutative diagram with 
  exact rows and vertical maps (canonical) isomorphisms
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
  {\Hom(\cF,\GG_a)} \& {\omega(\cF)} \& {\RigExt(\cF,\GG_a)} \&
  {\Ext(\cF,\GG_a)} \\ 
  \begin{array}{c} \left\{\begin{gathered} f \in TR\llbr T \rrbr : \\  \delta f
    = 0\end{gathered}  \right\} \end{array} \& \begin{array}{c}
    \left\{\begin{gathered} f \in (R\otimes_A K)\llbr T \rrbr : \\ 
  \text{$\delta f = 0$, $f(0) = 0$} \\
    \text{and $f'(T) \in R\llbr T \rrbr$}\end{gathered} \right\} \end{array} \& {\QLog(F)} \&
    {\frac{\SymCoc^2(F, \GG_a)}{\{\delta g \mid g \in T R\llbr T \rrbr\}}}
	\arrow[hook, "{\dc_F}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[two heads, from=1-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=2-3]
	\arrow[from=1-4, to=2-4]
	\arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["\delta", two heads, from=2-3, to=2-4]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  Injectivity of $\dc_F$ is provided by Proposition \ref{prop:loginvdiff},
  and related to the original exact sequence as $\Hom_R(\Lie(\cF), \Lie(\GG_a)) = 
  \omega(\cF)$.
  Surjectivity of $\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a) \to \Ext(\cF, \GG_a)$ comes from the
  fact that $\Lie(\cF)$ is projective. 
  The first vertical map is an equality, cf. Definitions
  \ref{def:SymCoc1} and \ref{def:formalmodulelaw}. 
  The vertical arrow describing $\omega(F)$ is obtained by
  identifying the preimage of $\omega(F) \subseteq \omega(F \otimes_R (R
  \otimes_AK))$ under the isomorphism 
  \begin{equation*}
    \{f \in T(R \otimes_A K)\llbr T \rrbr \mid \delta f = 0\} = \Hom_{\FMLOver A
    {R \otimes_A K}} (F \otimes (R \otimes_A K), \GG_a) \xto{\dc_F} \omega(F
    \otimes_R (R \otimes_AK)).
  \end{equation*}
  All squares commute by construction.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

We admit the following facts from Section 9 of \cite{hopkins1994equivariant}.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:InterestingSequenceStdMod}
  Let $F$ be a formal $A$-module law of height $h$ over a local, adic
  $A$-algebra $R$. Write $\cF$ for the formal $A$-module coming from 
  $F$. Then $\Ext(\cF, \GG_a)$ is a free $R$-module of rank $n-1$, 
  $\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a)$ is a free $R$-module of rank $n$. 
\begin{proof}
  This is Proposition 9.8 in the beforementioned source. The authors make
  use of a description of $\Ext(F, \GG_a)$ in terms of deformation theory
  and combine it with a convenient normal form of formal $A$-modules, so called
  $A$-typical modules (we touch upon the theory in section \ref{sub:Hazewinkels
  FuncEq and the Standard Formal Module}), to construct an explicit 
  basis for the corresponding modules. 
\end{proof}
\end{prop}
As a corollary, the authors obtain
\begin{lem}
  If $R \to R'$ is a homomorphism of local $A$-algebras, the induced maps 
  of free $R'$-modules
  \begin{gather*}
    \Ext_R(\cF, \GG_a) \otimes_R R' \to \Ext_{R'}(\cF, \GG_a) \\
    \RigExt_R(\cF, \GG_a) \otimes_R R' \to \RigExt_{R'}(\cF, \GG_a)
  \end{gather*}
  are isomorphisms.
\begin{proof}
  \cite[Corollary 9.13]{hopkins1994equivariant}.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

\begin{defi}[The Dieudonn\'e module of a formal $A$-module]\label{def:DioModule}
  Given $\cF \in \FMOver AR$, we define 
  $$\Dio(\cF) \coloneqq \Hom_R(\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a), R).$$ 
  We call $\Dio(\cF)$ the (covariant) Dieudonn\'e-module of $\cF$. 
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}[Crystalline Nature of $\Dio(-)$]\label{prop:DioCrystalline}
  The assignment $\cF \mapsto \Dio(\cF)$ yields a functor
  \begin{equation*}
    \FMOver AR \to \Mod R.
  \end{equation*}
  Given two formal $A$-modules $\cF, \cG \in \FMOver AR$ and two morphisms
  $\phi, \psi$ from $\cF$ to $\cG$ such that the induced morphisms of their reductions
  to $R/I$ agree, the induced morphisms $\Dio(\cF) \to \Dio(\cG)$ agree.

\subsection{The Universal Additive Extension} % (fold)
\label{sub:The Universal Additive Extension}
We follow \cite[Section 11]{hopkins1994equivariant}, 
and specialize to the situation where $A$ is a complete discrete valuation ring
with uniformizer $\varpi$ and finite residue field of characteristic $p$ and
$R$ is a local admissible $A$-algebra with residue field $\bar \FF_q$.

\begin{lem}
  Let $M$ be a finite free module over $R$. Then there is a natural bijection,
  functorial in $M$ and $\cF$
  \begin{equation*}
    \Ext(\cF, \GG_a \otimes M) \cong \Ext(\cF, \GG_a) \otimes_R M.
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  After choosing coordinates on $\cF$, this follows directly from the 
  description of $\Ext$ in terms of symmetric 2-cocycles, cf. Propositions
  \ref{prop:ClassOfFGLitoSymCoc} and \ref{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc}.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

Let $\cF$ be a one-dimensional formal $A$-module over $R$.
We put $\mathrm M(\cF) \coloneqq \Hom_R(\Ext(\cF, \GG_a), R)$, which is free of
rank $n-1$, and
write $\cV = \GG_a \otimes \mathrm M(\cF)$. Now, by the previous lemma,
\begin{equation*}
  \Ext(\cF,\cV) = \Ext(\cF, \GG_a \otimes \mathrm M(\cF)) = \End_R(\Ext(\cF, \GG_a)). 
\end{equation*}
Let $0 \to \cV \to \cE \to \cF \to 0$ be the extension corresponding to the identity 
on the right. This class is unique up to unique isomorphism. Indeed, 
as $R$ is a local ring we may choose formal module laws $F$ and $V$ giving rise
to $\cF$ and $\cV$, and let $E$ be the module law obtained from 
Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}. 
If $0 \to V \to E' \to F \to 0$ is another extension in this class, we
have by construction a commutative square
\begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	0 \& {V} \& E \& F \& 0 \\
	0 \& {V} \& {E'} \& F \& 0,
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=1-4]
	\arrow["i", from=1-3, to=2-3]
	\arrow[from=1-4, to=1-5]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-4, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation*}
and by Proposition \ref{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc} we see that 
any other isomorphism $i'$ making the diagram above commute differes from
$i$ by an element in $\Hom(F, V) = 0$. 

\begin{defi}[Universal Additive Extension]
  The extension
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cV \to \cE \to \cF \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  constructed above is called the universal additive extension of $\cF$.
\end{defi}

\begin{prop}
  If $N$ is a finite, free $R$-module, $\cG' = \GG_a \otimes N$ and 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \cG' \to \cE' \to F \to 0
  \end{equation*}
  is an extension of $\cF$ by $\cG'$, there are unique homomorphisms
    $i: \cE \to \cE'$ and $g': \cV \to \cG'$ making the diagram
  \begin{equation*}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	0 \& {\cV} \& \cE \& \cF \& 0 \\
	0 \& {\cG'} \& {\cE'} \& \cF \& 0
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=1-3]
	\arrow["{g'}"', from=1-2, to=2-2]

	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-4, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\arrow[from=2-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
\end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commute. In particular, we have $\cE' = g'_* \cE$. 
\begin{proof}
  As $\cV$ and $\cG'$ are additive, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \Hom(\cV, \cG') = \Hom_R(\mathrm M(\cF), N) = \Ext(\cF, \GG_a) \otimes N =
    \Ext(\cF, \cG').
  \end{equation*}
  This yields $g'$. Again, $i$ is unique as by observations similar to 
  Proposition \ref{prop:ExtInTermsOfSymCoc}, the difference of two
  morphisms $i,i':\cE \to \cE'$ is given a morphism $\cF \to \cG'$, which has
  to be trivial.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:LieAlgOfUnivAddExt}
  There is a natural isomorphism $\Lie(\cE) \xto \sim \Hom(\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a), R) 
  = \Dio(\cF)$.
\begin{proof}
  We show the equivalent statement $\omega(\cE) = \RigExt(\cF, \GG_a)$. 
  Let $(\cE', \omega_{\cE'}) \in \RigExt(\cF, \GG_a)$. Then by universality of 
  $\cE$, we obtain a unique homomorphism $i: \cE \to \cE'$. This yields a 
  homomorphism of $R$-modules $\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a) \to \omega(\cE)$, 
  sending a pair $(\cE', \omega_{\cE'})$ to $i^*\omega_{\cE'}$. This morphism
  fits into the following commutative diagram, where the top row is 
  the short exact sequence from Proposition \ref{prop:ExplicitInterestingES}
  and the bottom row is the dual short exact sequence of 
  $0 \to \Lie(\cV) \to \Lie(\cE) \to \Lie(\cF) \to 0$.
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
  	0 \& {\omega(\cF)} \& {\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a)} \& {\Ext(\cF, \GG_a)} \& 0 \\
  	0 \& {\omega(\cF)} \& {\omega(\cE)} \& {\omega(\cV)} \& 0
  	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]

  	\arrow[from=2-3, to=2-4]
  	\arrow[from=2-4, to=2-5]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  Thereby, $\RigExt(\cF, \GG_a) \to \omega(\cE)$ is a natural isomorphism.

\subsection{The Quasilogarithm Map} % (fold)
\label{sub:The Quasilogarithm map}
We keep the assumptions on $A$, $R$ and $S$ from the previous subsection. That is,
$A$ is a local ring with finite residue field and uniformizer $\varpi$, 
$R$ is a local $A$-algebra with maximal ideal $I$ complete with respect to
the $I$-adic topology and algebraically closed residue field $k_R$, and 
$S$ denotes an admissible $R$-algebra (where $R \to S$ is continuous with
the $I$-adic topology on $R$) with ideal of definition $J \subseteq S$ containing
the image of $I$. 

The aim of this subsection is to define, attached to any $\varpi$-divisible formal
$A$-module $\cF$ over $R$, a map
\begin{equation*}
\qlog_\cF: \tilde \cF(S) \to \Dio(\cF) \otimes_R (S \otimes_A K),
\end{equation*}
called the quasi-logarithm map.
We give an explicit description of this map if $\cF = H$ is the standard
$\cO_K$-module over $\cO_{\breve K}$. 

We begin with a sequence $(x_1, x_2, \dots) \in \tilde \cF(S)$. 
Let $0 \to \cV \xto\psi \cE \xto\phi \cF \to 0$ be the universal additive
extension of $\cF$, and choose an arbitrary sequence $(y_1, y_2, \dots) \in
\tilde \cE(S)$ such that $y_i$ is a lift of $x_i$ under the map $\cE(S) \to \cF(S)$. 
Let $y$ be the limit $y = \lim_{i \to \infty} [\varpi]_{\cE}^i(y_i)$ and put 
$$\qlog_\cF((x_1, x_2, \dots)) = \log_\cE(y) \in \Dio(\cF) \otimes_R(S \otimes_A K).$$ 

\begin{prop}
  This construction yields a well-defined map. 
\begin{proof}
  We may assume that $\cF$ and $\cV$ come from a formal module laws $F$ and 
  $V$, which canonically
  leads to a module $E$ for $\cE$ by Lemma \ref{lem:SESStandardForm}. Now
  $(x_1, x_2, \dots)$ is a sequence in $S^\cici$ and $(y_1, y_2, \dots)$ is a
  sequence of elements in $(S^\cici)^n$.

  It suffices to show that $y = \lim_{i\to \infty} [\varpi]^i_E(y_i)$ exists and 
  that it is independent of the choice of lifts $(y_1, y_2, \dots)$. 
  Both claims follow from additivity of $\cV$, implying that 
  $[\varpi]_{V}(T) = \varpi T$. The sequence 
  $([\varpi^i]_{E}(y_i))$ converges, as for positive integers $i\leq j$, we have 
  \begin{equation*}
    [\varpi^i](y_i) - [\varpi^j](y_j) = [\varpi^i]([\varpi^{i-j}]y_j - y_i)
    \in \psi(\varpi^i (S^\cici)^{n-1}) \subseteq J^i (S^\cici)^{n}. 
  \end{equation*}

  If $(y_1', y'_2, \dots)$ is another sequence of lifts, put
  $y' = \lim_{i \to \infty} [\varpi^i]_E (y_i') \in S^\cici$. Now there exists some
  $z \in \cV(S)$ such that 
  $y - y' = \psi(z)$. But by construction
  $z \in \bigcap_{i \in \N} \varpi^i(S^{\cici})^{n-1} = 0$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

Let us now consider the case where $\cF = \FGG(H)$ comes from the standard
formal $\cO_K$-module of height $n$ over $\cO_{\breve K}$. Then 
from Proposition \ref{prop:InterestingSequenceStdMod} we have the distinguished
basis elements of $\Ext(H,\GG_a)$ corresponding to the symmetric $2$-cocycles
$\delta f_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ where $f_i(T) = \frac 1 \varpi
\log_H(T^{q^i})$. Also recall that, setting $f_0(T) = \log_H(T)$, the elements 
$(f_0, f_1, \dots, f_{n-1})$ freely generate $\QLog(H)$. The universal
additive extension now corresponds to the symmetric $2$-cocycle $(\delta f_1,
\dots, \delta f_{n-1}) \in \SymCoc^2(H,V)$.
We can make the quasi-logarithm map explicit.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:qlogmapExplicit}
  Let $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots) \in \Tilde H(S)$. With respect to the basis
  $(\log_H(T),\allowbreak \log_H(T^q), \allowbreak \dots, \allowbreak \log_H(T^{q^{n-1}}))$ of 
  $\QLog(H) \otimes_{\cO_K} K$, the quasi-logarithm map is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    \qlog_H(x) = \left(\log_H(x_0), \log_H((\Pi x)_0), \dots, \log_H((\Pi^{n-1}
    x)_0)\right) \in (S\otimes K)^n.
  \end{equation*}
  Here, $\Pi x = ((\Pi x)_0, (\Pi x)_1, \dots)$ is the image of $x$ under
  $\Pi$, the endomorphism of $\Tilde
  H(S)$ induced by the Frobenius automorphism on $H_0$, cf. Definition
  \ref{def:FrobOnUnivCov}.
\end{prop}
We postpone the proof to state the following auxiliary result.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:FrobOnTildeHExpl}
  Let $x = (x_0 ,x_1, \dots) \in \Tilde H(S)$. For positive integers $i$ and
  $j$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_H((\Pi^j x)_i) = \lim_{r \to \infty} \varpi^r \log_H(x_{r+i}^{q^j}).
  \end{equation*}
\begin{proof}
  Tracing through the commutative square (with $\lambda$ and $\mu$ the
  isomorphisms from the previous subsection)
    \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	{\Tilde H(S)} \& {\Nilp^\flat(S)} \\
    	{\Tilde H(S)} \& {\Nilp^\flat(S),}
    	\arrow["\lambda", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow["\Pi", from=1-1, to=2-1]
    	\arrow["{(y_i)_i \mapsto (y_i^{q})_i}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["\mu"', from=2-2, to=2-1]
    \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation*}
    we find 
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:CompsOfPiExplicit}
      (\Pi^j x)_i = \lim_{s \to \infty} \lim_{r\to\infty} \left([\varpi]_H^s
      (x_{r+s+i}^{q^{nr + j}})\right).
    \end{equation}
    The claim follows after applying $\log_H$ and making repeated use of the
    functional equation $\log_H(T^{q^n}) = \varpi \log_H(T) + \varpi T$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:qlogmapExplicit}]
  Using the coordinates provided by $(\delta f_1, \dots, \delta f_{n-1})$, the
  universal additive extension of $H$ is isomorphic to 
  \begin{equation*}
    0 \to \GG_a^{n-1} \to E \to H \to 0,
  \end{equation*}
  where $E$ is a module law with 
  \begin{equation*}
    [\varpi]_E(\bX, T) = \big(\varpi X_1 + (\delta_{\varpi}f_1)(T), \dots, \varpi X_{n-1} + 
    (\delta_{\varpi}f_{n-1})(T), [\varpi]_H(T)\big).
  \end{equation*}
  Beginning with $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots) \in \Tilde H (S)$, lifting to $(y_0,
  y_1, \dots) \in E(S)^\N$ 
  and writing $y = \lim_{i\to\infty} [\varpi]_E^i (y_i)$, we find
  \begin{equation*}
    y = \left(\lim_{r\to\infty} (\delta_{\varpi^r} f_1)(x_r), \dots, \lim_{r\to \infty}
    (\delta_{\varpi^r}f_{n-1})(x_r), x_0\right) \in E(S).
  \end{equation*}
  Now, Lemma \ref{lem:FrobOnTildeHExpl} provides the equality
  $$\lim_{r\to\infty}\delta_{\varpi^r} f_i(x_r) = \frac 1\varpi \lim_{r \to \infty}
  \varpi^r \log_H(x_r^{q^{nr+i}}) - \frac 1\varpi \log_H\left(x_0^{q^i}\right) = 
  \frac 1\varpi \left(\log_H((\Pi^i x)_0)- \log_H(x_0^{q^i})\right).$$
  We need to calculate $\log_E(y)$, which calls for an explicit description of 
  $\log_E : E \otimes (R \otimes_AK) \to (\GG_a \otimes(R \otimes_A K))^n$. 
  Tracing through the procedure provided in Subsection \ref{sub:Logarithms},
  we find
  \begin{equation*}
    \log_E(\bX, T) = \left(X_1 + \tfrac 1\varpi \log_H(T^q), \dots, 
    X_{n-1} + \tfrac 1\varpi \log_H(T^{q^{n-1}}), \log_H(T)\right).
  \end{equation*}
  This representation is with respect to the basis $(f_1, \dots, f_{n-1}, f_0)$. 
  The claim follows.
\end{proof}

\label{sub:Determinants}
Let $H$ be the standard formal $\cO_K$-module over $\cO_{\breve K}$ of height
$n$. Write $\wedge H$ for the formal $\cO_K$-module over $\cO_{\breve K}$ with
logarithm
\begin{equation*}
  \log_{\wedge H}(T) = \sum_{i = 0}^\infty (-1)^{(n-1)i} \frac{T^{qi}}{\varpi^i}.
\end{equation*}
We have $\Dio(\wedge H) = \wedge^n \Dio(H)$. 
We follow \cite[Theorem 2.10.3]{BoyarchenkoWeinstein2011MaxVar} to describe a map $\delta:
\Tilde H^n \to \Tilde {\wedge H}$ making the square
\begin{equation}\label{diag:qlogsquare}
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
	{\Tilde H^n(S)} \& {\Tilde{\wedge H}(S)} \\
	{\Dio(H)^n \otimes (S\otimes_{\cO_K} K)} \& {\Dio(\wedge H) \otimes(S\otimes_{\cO_K}K)}
	\arrow["\delta", from=1-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["\qlog_H \times \dots \times \qlog_H"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
  \arrow["\qlog_{\wedge H}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["\det", from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
commute. 

Let $(s_1, \dots, s_n) \in \Tilde H(S)^n$, and write $x_i = \lambda(s_i) \in
\Nilp^\flat(S)$, which are elements in $S^\cici$ with distinguished $q$-power
roots. Here $\lambda: \Tilde H \to \Nilp^\flat$ is the isomorphism from Section
\ref{sub:Tate Modules and the Universal Cover} with inverse $\mu = (\mu_0, \mu_1, \dots)$. 
We set
\begin{equation*}
  \delta_0(s_1, \dots, s_n) = \sum_{(a_1, \dots, a_n)} \varepsilon(a_1, \dots
  a_n) \mu_0(x_1^{q^{a_1}} \cdots x_n^{q^{a_n}}) \in \wedge H(S),
\end{equation*}
where 
\begin{itemize}
  \item the sum ranges over $n$-tuples $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ of (possibly negative) integers 
    satisfying $a_1 + \dots + a_n = n (n-1)/2$, subject to the
    condition that each $a_i$ occupies a distinct residue class modulo $n$.
  \item The expression $\varepsilon(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ denotes the sign of the 
    permutation $i \mapsto a_{i+1}$ (mod $n$) of $(0, \dots, n-1)$.
  \item The sum takes place in ${\wedge H}(S)$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{prop}
  The map $\delta_0$ makes the diagram 
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
    	{\tilde H^n(S)} \& {\wedge H(S)} \\
    	{D(H)^n \otimes (S \otimes K)} \& {D(\wedge H) \otimes(S \otimes K)}
    	\arrow["{\delta_0}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
    	\arrow["{\qlog_H^n}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
    	\arrow["{\log_{\wedge H}}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
    	\arrow["\det", from=2-1, to=2-2]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}
  commute. It is $\cO_K$-multilinear and alternating.
\begin{proof}
  This is part of the proof of \cite[Theorem
  2.10.3]{BoyarchenkoWeinstein2011MaxVar}.
  Commutativity follows from 
  \begin{multline*}
    \log_{\wedge H}(\delta_0(s_1, \dots, s_n)) = \sum_{(a_1, \dots, a_n)} 
    \varepsilon(\mathbf a) \log_{\wedge H} \mu_0( x_1^{q^{a_1}}\cdots x_n^{q^{a_n}})
     \\ = \sum_{(a_1, \dots, a_n)} \varepsilon(\mathbf a) \sum_{m \in \Z} (-1)^{(n-1)m}
    \frac{x_1^{q^{a_1+m}} \cdots x_n^{q^{a_n+m}}}{\varpi^m} 
    = \det \left( \sum_{m \in \Z} \frac{x_i^{q^{mn + j-1}}}{\varpi^m} \right)_{\substack{
      1 \leq i \leq n,\\
      1 \leq j \leq n}},
  \end{multline*}
  which is equal to $\det(\qlog_H^n(s_1, \dots, s_n))$ by Proposition 
  \ref{prop:qlogmapExplicit} and Lemma \ref{lem:LogInTermsOfNil}. 
  The fact that $\delta_0$ is multilinear and alternating ultimately follows
  from the corresponding properties of $\det$, the fact that $\ker(\log_H) =
  \wedge H[\varpi^\infty]$ (cf. Lemma \ref{lem:KernelOfLog}) and topological considerations
  in the induced diagram in the category of adic spaces over $(\breve K, \cO_{\breve K})$.
\end{proof}
\end{prop}

This allows us to define the sought for morphism of functors
$\delta: \Tilde H^n \to \Tilde {\wedge H}$. 
\begin{defi}\label{def:DeltaMap}
  Put $\delta_i(s_1, \dots, s_n) = \delta_0(\varpi^{-i} s_1, \dots, s_n)$. Then 
  $\delta = (\delta_0, \delta_1, \dots)$ yields a map 
  $\Tilde H^n \to \Tilde{\wedge H}$. It is $K$-multilinear and alternating.
\end{defi}

Using the canonical identificaitons $\Tilde {H}^n \cong (\Nilp^\flat)^n$
and $\Tilde{\wedge H} \cong \Nilp^\flat$, the morphism $\delta$ yields a 
map $(\Nilp^\flat)^n \to \Nilp^\flat$, which in turn is the same as a power series 
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta(X_1, \dots, X_n) \in \cO_{\breve K}\llbr X_1^{q^{-\infty}}, \dots,
  X_n^{q^{-\infty}}\rrbr
\end{equation*}
together with distinguished $q$-th power roots. 
We have the following approximation of $\Delta$. 
\begin{lem}\label{lem:DeltaApprox}
  We have $\Delta(X_1, \dots, X_n) \equiv \det(X_i^{q^{j-1}})_{\substack{1 \leq i \leq n,\\ 1 \leq j \leq n}}$ modulo $(X_1, \dots, X_n)^{q^n}$.
\begin{proof}
  \red{TODO. This is \cite[Lemma 2.10.4]{BoyarchenkoWeinstein2011MaxVar}, but they
  don't explain the proof.}
\end{proof}
\end{lem}
