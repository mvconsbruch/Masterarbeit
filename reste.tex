We highlight two equivalent
characterizations of relative position. 

\begin{prop}\label{prop:RelativePosition2}
  A pair of flags $(\Flag, \Flag')$ is in relative position $w \in \Sigma_n$ 
  if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists a faithfully flat finitely presented $S$-scheme 
      $\phi: S' \to S$ (with structure map to $\spec k$ denoted by $f'$) and a
      $n$-tuple of global sections 
      $$(v_1, \dots, v_n) \in \Gamma(S', f'^* \tilde V)^n$$ satisfying for all $i =
      1, \dots, n$ that 
      \begin{equation*}
        \phi^* F_i  = \langle v_1, \dots, v_i \rangle
        \quad \text{ and } \quad 
        \phi^* F'_i  = \langle v_{w(1)}, \dots, v_{w(i)} \rangle
      \end{equation*}
      inside $f'^* \tilde V$. 
    \item For all $i,j = 1, \dots, n$, the quasi-coherent $\cO_S$-module 
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:RelPosCond}
        W_{ij}(\Flag, \Flag') \coloneq \frac{F_i \cap F'_{j}}{F_{i-1} \cap F'_{j} +
        F_i \cap F'_{j-1}}
      \end{equation}
      is non-vanishing if and only if $w(j) = i$. In this case it is always
      locally free of rank $1$.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
    The first condition is a reformulation of the fact that the orbit scheme
    $O_w$ is isomorphic to the $\fppf$-sheafification of 
    $\GL(V)/(B_{\Flag} \cap B_{\Flag'})$, cf. \cite[Definition 5.20 and
    Corollary 7.13]{milne2017algebraic}. Indeed, given any choice 
    of 'standard' basis $(e_1, \dots, e_n)$ of $V$, any section $(\Flag, \Flag')$
    in the orbit of $(\Flag^\std, w.\Flag^\std)$ (as in the previous proof), we
    may choose $S'$ such that there exists a $g \in \GL(V)(S')$ 
    satisfying $g.(\Flag^\std|_{S'}, w.\Flag^{\std}|_{S'}) = (\Flag, \Flag')$.
    Now it is easily seen that $v_i = g(e_i) \in \Gamma(S', f^*\tilde V)$
    satisfy the desired conditions. Conversely, any such basis yields lifts
    to $\GL(V)(S')$.

    To obtain the second characterization, pick a $\fppf$-scheme $S'$ as in the
    first condition, yielding the tuple of generators $(v_1, \dots, v_n)$. On
    $S'$, the space $W_{ij}(\Flag, \Flag')$ is non-vanishing if and only if
    $v_{i} \in F'_j \setminus F'_{j-1}$, or equivalently, $\sigma(i) = j$. In
    this case, the module is free of rank $1$. As the condition
    of quasi-coherent modules to be locally free of rank $1$ can be checked 
    fppf-locally (cf. \cite[Proposition 14.48]{gortz2020algebraic}), the claim 
    follows.
  \end{proof}
\end{prop}
